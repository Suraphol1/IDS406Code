Reviews
Thayers Witch Hazel Rose Petals is my favorite. I cannot say that i've noticed a big difference in my skin but it's about how the product makes me feel. I usually do a few swipes on my face with a cotton round and it helps me feel refreshed. i like that it also takes off some of the makeup i fail to wash away. The scent is perfect too!! I've been a loyal customer for a few years and i will continue to be. so worth it for me.I like to use morning and night but if i wasn't wearing makeup i would likely do it more often.
"I decided to try this product after it appeared the one I’d been using for years was no longer available. I am SO glad I did!  Witch hazel is witch hazel, but I feel like this product works better than my previous brand.  And the hint of rose is nice without being over powering.  Now let’s hope this product does not go away any time soon."
"THAYERS hydrating facial toner works really well with my skin type (dry+oily) and also absorbs and leaves a nice finish on ur face. The only slight problem is the smell. It may be the cucumber but I'm not sure, but I personally don't like it but the smell isn't strong enough for it to really bother you."
I’ve grown to believe that toner is really not a necessary step in my regiment. But this one has definitely changed my opinion. It is so refreshing. I use it in a spray bottle that spritzes a fine mist. The lavender is absolutely divine. The reviews are what encouraged me to give it a try and I’m glad I did. I was able to get this on sale and will probably keep using it daily after washing my face & prior to any serums. I believe it has everything to do with the brand.  I’m sold.
This toner has been around for ages for a reason its great and doesn't dry out or irritate skin must buy.
I have never used a toner and I am 52 years old. This stuff is amazing! No scent at all... cleans amazing. Does not leave face dry or oily... but just right!
My son and i use this toner religiously. It helps keep our face clean and smooth at the end of the night and moisturized during the day! Its a staple when i travel especially when my skin feels dry after being on the plane or if i just need a freshening up! Lavender is our fav scent
"Thayers is found in most pharmacies, but not in cucumber, which led me to this purchase.  Great choice. I use this as a pre after shave."
"I have been using this Thayers toner for just over a year. I love this product. My face is not getting younger but it certainly looks clean and healthy. The cucumber is a nice refreshing wake up in the morning and a fresh swipe at the end of the day to wash away the daily grime.Pricing on here is extremely cheap compared to brick and morter.Regardless of where I purchase it, I will definitely continue to use this great product. Go Witchhazel!"
My fave and I am happy it’s reasonably priced.
Muy buen producto deja limpio y fresco
"Me encanta este tónico desde su textura, su aroma y la sensación en mi piel. No me ha causado irritación ni reacciones. El tamaño es muy bueno y en comparación con otros portales, este es el más barato en estos momentos."
"Dudaba mucho en comprar este producto pues en la rutina de skin care no es taaan necesario un tonico, sin embargo me arriesgue y que bueno que lo hice. Mi piel es grasa y en conjunto con mi rutina ayudan a mantenerlo bajo control. Llevo un mes utilizándolo y no he tenido acné. Me refresca el rostro y ayuda a absorber tu hidratante. Vale la pena probarlo."
"CeraVe Hydrating Toner for Face has been a true game-changer for my skincare routine. Here’s my take on it:1. **Hydration**: This toner is packed with Hyaluronic Acid, which provides excellent hydration. It feels refreshing and instantly moistens my skin without leaving any tightness.2. **Gentle Formula**: Designed specifically for sensitive dry skin, this non-alcoholic formula is soothing. I appreciate that it doesn’t irritate or cause redness.3. **Key Ingredients**: The inclusion of Niacinamide helps to improve the skin’s barrier and tackle uneven skin tone, while Ceramides strengthen and protect the skin, making it feel more resilient.4. **Fragrance-Free**: As someone sensitive to fragrances, I love that this toner is completely fragrance-free. It doesn't have any overpowering scents, just a clean, light feel.5. **Non-Comedogenic**: It hasn’t clogged my pores, which is a huge plus. My skin feels clean and clear after use.Overall, CeraVe Hydrating Toner has proven to be an essential part of my skincare routine, providing hydration without stripping my skin’s moisture. A fantastic choice for anyone with sensitive, dry skin!"
"CeraVe toner works great. I use this as the final step of cleansing my face. I let it absorb and dry, which is a minute before I put my moisturizer on my face. The scent is minimal, it’s hydrating and leaves your face feeling thoroughly clean."
I use this before anything else and it helps my other products glide on with ease. It is hydrating and feels great on the skin. It also interacts well with a vitamin C serum.
Good my face is clean
"This toner made me realize I have been using the wrong formulas for years. Toners tend to dry me out but I didn't really care if I was about to moisturize anyway. Turns out, moisture at every single step is the way to go for someone with dry skin problems. It improved everything for me."
"I use a large cotton ball to stroke on this product, after washing my face.  It removes the ""tight"" feeling I get after washing with any product, no matter how mild.  It does not cause any break-outs, which has been the case with other toners I've tried.  Just refreshing hydration!"
"I hope they never change their formulas.. because since I've tried cerave, I only want to get cerave. I use the face wash, retinol cream and now I'm trying this because I wanted something with hyaluronic acid and niacinamides.. well I'm so glad I did, I've only used it for 3 days and my face feels so soft and amazing. Its unreal this bottle is 10 bucks. I love it. Can't wait to see what my skin will look like in a couple weeks !"
"I've recently begun an intensive skin routing (serums, moisturizers etc) and purchased this toner to complement the Cereve cleanser that I've used and liked for many years. Since using toner is new to me, I was not expecting for it to feel sticky/tacky afterwards.  It does seem to remove extra dirt/makeup that the cleanser missed, but I don't care for the sticky feeling afterwards.  Maybe all toners feel like this?"
"Me encantó, es un producto de mucha calidad y precio justo!!"
Conosco la marca ma in questo caso il prezzo non è rapportato alla qualità .Se sfiori gli occhi bruciano
I like it too much.
"I use this all the time and just thought I'd leave a review for anyone looking for a recommendation, this is perfect for all skin types, keeps skin looking hydrated and even and makes me feel great x"
Haven’t use yet fasting deliver packing is good I love cerave products it’s very effective product
I have used this toner for years and still love it! I have very dry skin. This toner does not dry my face. I also use Neutrogena cleanser first and finish up with the toner. Then I apply Neutrogena moisturizer.
Best one I’ve found sonfar
"I received this toner today packaged with numerous other subscription products. This bottle was not put in plastic bag, leaked about half the product out. The rest of the box was fine but I'm just out half my toner!"
works great on my skin it doesnt dry my skin.
"I’ve been using the Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Gentle Daily Fragrance-Free Face Toner for a while now, and it’s become an essential part of my skincare routine. I even have it on auto-delivery every six weeks because it works so well!What I love most about this toner is that it’s alcohol-free, so it’s incredibly gentle on my skin. Unlike other toners that can be harsh and drying, this one leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed. It does an excellent job of toning and prepping my skin for the rest of my routine without any irritation.If you’re looking for a toner that’s effective yet gentle, I highly recommend giving this one a try. It’s made a noticeable difference in my skin’s texture and overall appearance."
Great face toner/clarifer.  Gentle.  No alcohol.
"The product matches the description, is alcohol-free, and has no fragrance. I have used it and am satisfied with the product."
the product seems fine but it would be better if its sealed
Not sure why such a simple ingredient causes such burn on my skin. Product were not seal. Had to stop using. Disappointed
I use this after every shower on a cotton round pad on my crevasses and creases of my body even the bikini area i am a plus size girlie I also use it on my 🍑 and face. I love this it makes me feel so fresh
This face toner cleans your face very well taking away all the dirt and residue . It's makes your skin feel relaxed and looks appealing after using it . You get a big bottle that can serve you for a long period of time .
"Only a little more than generic brands, love this product. Amazon has less expensive than any local stores that stock this. It's basically witch hazel, great for removing makeup or dabbing on your butt if you suffer from hemorrhoids. Bottle looks fine on the bathroom counters if that matters. I ordered 4."
"I have oily skin and I purchased this product as a replacement for a long-time favorite pore-refining toner that was sadly discontinued. I wanted something alcohol-based, to cut the oil, and something that would close my pores, which is what witch hazel does. This is pure witch hazel, which is naturally tinctured with alcohol, so it seemed ideal. Unfortunately, witch hazel itself has an unpleasant aroma, so even though this is ""unscented"" it isn't without scent. I put a few drops of food-grade lavender extract into it (alcohol-based tincture), and it helped, so I think people could get creative and try whatever other alcohol-based flavoring agent they like in it to mask the witch hazel aroma. This would solve the problem most people find with this otherwise good product. One thing to note: Dickinson's is a fairly mild astringent, not as strong as the pore-refining toners that contain salicylic acid."
I have tried a bunch of different toners and this one is by far the best. It always leaves my skin clean and fresh! I use it morning and night.
This is a gentle skin toner. I use it mostly on my face and I am loving the results after each use. It removes the oil and brightens my face.
I have used Witch Hazel for years and I really like it.  It removes any traces left of makeup removal cream after my face is washed.
"I've used Dickinson's for years! Every few years I'll try some new-fangled stuff that hits the market (like micellar water) but nothing, absolutely nothing makes my skin feel as soft and fresh as this."
It’s refreshing and closes pores. I don’t use everyday tho.  But twice a week… would buy again it cleans out pores effectively
También es buena para limpiar el exceso de aceite en la cara durante el día.
"Perfekte Lösung für beanspruchte Haut. Reinigt, pflegt und minimiert Poren sowie Falten. Der Geruch ist gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber ist auch nicht unangenehm. Sehr zufrieden und werde ich nachbestellen! Glasklare Empfehlung!"
Haven’t been happy with my toner so tried this . The smell is strange but not overpowering . Did a good job for a fraction of the price. My partner gets lots of bits in his eyes due to his work and uses this to rinse out his eyes . Good product

"Mi piel: mixta y MUY SENSIBLE.Esta es mi primera usada del producto, en 3 meses vuelvo para decirles si funciono.El producto trae muy buena cantidad, vence en 12 meses después de abierto.Es un líquido con un poco de aroma, el aroma no me gusto mucho pero no es tan molestoso, solo se siente al ponerlo, ya después no huele.Normalmente compro productos que digan skin sensitive para evitar que me arda (y al ser mi cara MUY sensible aun así me arden la mayoría), pero con este me aventuré porque decía que es para todo tipos de pieles y busque reseñas y decían que lo puede usar una piel sensible.No me ardió, no sentí una molestia y sobre todo no me activó la rosácea. En la primera aplicada me gusto bastante."
"For the price, vegan, clean and fragrance free this is now my go to products. It's hydrated my skin, improved my wrinkles, redness in my skin has all but disappeared, my skin texture is soft and even.It is slightly sticky but once I put on the Good Molecules light moisturizer everything softens and it's a good base for makeup. My skin is brighter and it does what it says it does, very effective."
"This was my first toner I tried a few months ago when I was getting into skincare…. I’ve graduated to k beauty and using some others but this will remain my base!!!! It really brightened my skin and tightened my pores. I ran out and tried to use something else but noticed I didn’t glow as much, wasn’t as smooth,  and pores were more noticeable…. So I repurchased immediately. It has vitamin c, hyaluronic acid, arbutin, and niacinamide. It’s a great toner!"
i used it for a while and it shows very fast improvement i have pretty red skin and it really helps with that :)
Started my face routine with this product and I’ve noticed a big difference will be buying again
"Love this product so much, cleared up my discoloration within weeks. Definitely repurchasing"
Im using it on my face and I see improvement. Great product
I've used a couple of toners but this one doesn't dry out my skin and it leaves it moisturized while clearing out the dark spots I have. I wish it were bigger for this price because I used it up in a month
"Me agrada la sensación de frescura que deja en mi piel, con el uso continuo mi rostro se va viendo radiante, sin duda compraré nuevamente"
روعه فعلا يفتح وينظف انصح فيه على فكره خلص اليوم وبرجع اطلبه
It's good..had cleared my dark spots..
It looks and feels like plain water.
My best project
"This toner is SO CLEAN AND PURE!Does not dry skin, does not leave sticky and zero fragrance!I've purchased toners that are double, triple the price of the ELF toner. Elf is by far the best!If you're looking to simplifying your skincare routine, start with this toner!"
Excelente productoMuy recomendado
"This could be used on its own if all you want is a product that soothes the skin and has ingredients that repair and support the skin barrier. And it would be a great product if used as such. It absorbs very quickly and its niacinamide concentration is estimated by 3rd party labs to be right at the 3% mark which is in the range of peak effectiveness based on existing research. It's also difficult to find this much ceramides in a product with hyaluronic acid, so it really cuts down on a lot of skincare steps.However, where this things really excels is when paired with irritating products. You can layer on more actives, you can use a higher concentration of tretinoin/retinal, you can use kojic acid/hydroquinone a lot more easily if used after this toner. I had a real problem tolerating even 0.02% tret every other day, even using the sandwich method and layering multiple moisturizers, but with this toner I'm using a higher concentration every day directly applied on top of the toner without any extra moisturizing. It was a real game changer. The Witch hazel, aloe vera, and flower water really help.The fact that it cuts down multiple skincare steps already makes it worth using, but it's also incredibly fast absorbing which saves even more time, and it enables usage of stronger skincare ingredients makes this by far my favorite product and discovery of 2024. There really is nothing else like it at this (or any?) price point."
It’s not harsh like the one I used to use from Clinique. A very balanced soothing toner which moisturizes the skin
"i love this toner sm, makes my skin look great"
Makes my skin feel very soft and it dries fast.  My skin is glowing!Great product and the price can't be beat!Just ordered it again.
I live by this toner .. why spend so much money on high end brands when drugstore products to the same or even better work. I’ve been using this toner for months and I can certainly tell a difference my face is always pump and hydrated . Good under makeup . Highly recommend.
"I have combination skin with an oily t-zone and I realized I really need a toner that can clean out my pores of everything left after cleansing, and though this toner is very nourishing, it doesn't clean well, which is why I gave it a lower rating.I had more breakouts when I switched from my usual biore witch hazel toner, to this, however it does leave your skin very soft.I think it would be great if you have dry or sensitive skin. But if you are even a little prone to breakouts I'd steer clear of this one."
Quotidien
"Normalmente batallo para encontrar un producto que se ajuste a mi tipo de piel, ya que muchos no se absorben bien o me dejan la piel con una sensación grasa.Pero este toner me ha ayudado bastante a controlar el brillo y la oleosidad de mi cara, y lo mejor es que solo necesitas muy poco producto para que funcione.Es la segunda vez que lo compro,  y primera que lo veo a la venta en México."
"I love elf products. This toner works so well. No stinging and no sticky residue, just soft, fresh skin, ready to be moisurised."
Works well I'm very pleased
It's not easy to find a good toner in this country but this one is great. It moistures and smooth my skin. No strong scent and it feels calming. This is my 3rd bottle and I will buy again.
Love how my fave feels after using this product. Doesn’t irritate my skin. No smell
Si es un poco fuerte pero me a ayudado mucho con los poros y eso es casi imposible en mi piel. lo uso diario pero solo 1 vez al dia ya que tambien uso otras cremas y productos para el acne.
My skin is very sensitive to breakouts of white and black heads.  La Roche-Posay Effaclar products work best with my skin problems.
Promete lo que dice
"I just started being more proactive about my skincare and wanted to find a good toner. I have sensitive skin and some bumps on my face. As of right now, even adding the toner, I haven’t had any new bumps or blemishes pop up. I use it morning and nights right before I use Vanicream moisturizer and it doesn’t dry out my skin. I haven’t seen it make it look rejuvenated or reduce any dark spots (but I wasn’t expecting it to.) I will see how it works long term, but currently it’s going exactly what it’s supposed to."
"This toner worked wonders for my skin. I combine this with their wash & follow up with their moisturizer. My skin appears smoother, exfoliated and more even."
The best face cleanser. I use all la roche posay products. Never let me down. Packaged great!
A
Feels nice on your skin & doesn't dry it out.
"Can get drying so don't go overboard. have combination skin, I use it merely in my t-zone.Make sure u riding an aqueous moisturizer"
It makes face sticky. All the hype no results. It's very slow and would take ages to show some results. The main point is it makes my face sticky and I hate such products.
"As an older woman, I have dry skin.  Several years ago I started using Neutrogena Hydro Boost water cream moisturizer to my face 2X a day after cleansing/exfoliating with a simple washcloth and I  noticed a huge difference.  Then I learned about serums, and started applying the Hydro Boost hyaluronic acid serum to my face before the facial cream, and again noticed an improvement in my skin.  I recently read about incorporating a toner into my regimen.  I don’t want to spend a lot of money on products, so I tried this Rice Toner from “I’m From” and WOW!  I apply it with my fingers all over my face and neck before the serum.  It smoothes out my skin and seems to help the absorption of the serum and water cream.  It isn’t sticky and dries quickly. My skin is glowing.  I now need to find a foundation that doesn’t dull this glow.I will be adding this milky skin toner to my daily routine morning and night."
This toner has made a world of difference for my skin! I've been using it pretty much nightly and I notice a difference in less than two weeks. I noticed the biggest difference wile on video calls; I didn't even have to have my ring light on and I had a natural highlight! I've already recommended this to personal friends and repurchased. Highly recommend
"I’ve been using it for a couple of years now, it makes your skin so soft so moist, as soon as you put on and as it dries, you see the difference."
"I just used this several times,too early to review but ill be back"
"I’m From Rice Toner** has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine! The formula, with 77.78% Korean rice extract, gives my skin a noticeable glow and leaves it feeling deeply hydrated. I have combination skin, and this toner strikes the perfect balance by moisturizing without feeling heavy or greasy.I also love that it contains niacinamide, which has brightened my complexion over time and helped even out my skin tone. It’s vegan, fragrance-free, and gentle, so it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin. The milky texture absorbs quickly, leaving my face smooth and refreshed, helping me achieve that ""glass skin"" look.If you’re looking for a toner that hydrates, brightens, and nourishes, this one is a must-try. Plus, the glass bottle feels luxurious, making it worth every penny!"
"The I'm From Rice Toner is a game changer for my skincare routine! The milky texture feels lightweight and hydrating, instantly soothing my skin. After just a few uses, my complexion became brighter and more radiant. It absorbs quickly without leaving any sticky residue and provides the perfect amount of moisture. I’ve also noticed an improvement in my skin's texture—it feels smoother and more even. If you're looking for a gentle toner that gives a healthy glow, this one is a must-try!"
"Will definitely buy it again. It's so soothing and moisturizing!When I finish washing my face, my skin always feels dry and tight, no matter what cleanser I use. After applying this toner, the redness almost immediately goes away, and my skin becomes soft and nice. No stickiness. It's a working product as a first step after face cleansing, will re-purchase it. Of course, it's not hydrating enough on its own!The only little downside I'd note: a pump would probably be more convenient than the lid with a hole; also, the toner is a bit too liquid, so it takes some practice to apply it on the face without losing it on the way to it :D"
"I had high hopes for this toner but honestly it is not as good as Dickson's $4 moisture Witch Hazel.  It doesn't get embedded sirt from pores, it is OK on moisturzing, but I see no difference in texture, pore size, and smoothness.  It is not useless.  I will use it but will not rebuy."
"I've used to buy a different cream every time, most of them ended up in a trash can after a couple uses. My skin is highly irritable, and reacts to all sorts of stuff. For especially nasty ingredients I get a special bonus - dermatitis when half of my face looks like I fell asleep on a burner.BUT This cream/toner combo changed my life. For real. I have finally stopped looking for a better option, because I found the best.This gives your skin glow, it looks so healthy, plump, and youthful. It gave me ZERO breakouts, and cleared my black dots!!!I was once on a subway with my husband, we were standing really really close to each other, and my nose was directly before his eyes. In a very surprised voice he said - WOW, how did your skin get so clear and beautiful??Haha, well, that's how. This is my holy grail, this is the secret I don't want to gate-keep.The only semi-cons, is - it has to be used with the cream of same series.I wash my face with water, I don't wipe the water off, and apply toner.Then I can wait for it to dry up, or if I don't have time - I put a bit of cream on top.It's not greasy at all, so I sometimes re-apply in the middle of the day, after a workout or something. Use it daily and nightly, it's also amazing under makeup as a primer."
Me encantó es un buen producto.
il toner migliore abbia mai provato!anche senza la crema (stessa marca) la pelle risplende. Fantastico
"I really struggled with texture around my T zone and scarring on my chin and had tried everything to try and reduce these issues but nothing had worked until I tried this product. I had never usually expected much from toners, but this toner is amazing !!!!! consistency is key with this product and you won’t see results immediately but when it works it WORKS ( i use morning and night)"
"Holt mehr Schmutz auf der Haut runter, als ich dachte ."
I really like this product! Why you ask?  Because it really helped minimize my pores.  My skin feels and looks smoother now.  I’m glad I bought this product!  Will purchase again for sure!!  😀
I have only used this for 2 days and I am shocked. The noticeable difference in pore size happens immediately after applying. What kind of witchcraft is this?
"I waste a lot of money trying new products because I break out so easily if the ingredients are not all natural. I get actual hives bro. Anyways. I unfortunately have been experiencing dryness and breakouts BUT my pores have closed significantly. I’m going to keep using it and see if my skin adapts, because so far no HIVES. I’m happy with it in spite of the breakouts and dryness(: I’m thinking it may just be an adapting period for my skin."
This is the first time I buy a product that makes my pores noticeably smaller in just a couple of days. I’m in love
"This is my new best friend! I absolutely love the results. I wasn’t expecting it to be instant, but my pores are VISIBLY smaller and way less noticeable after just one use! Buy it."
Been using this for several weeks and I'm very happy with the results.  I will buy this again.
I have been using this for about 2 weeks now no noticeable difference at all but it gives my face a very nice clean feeling so I'm going to keep trying
It's doing the work.... shrinking my pores!
"This toner is good value for the price, lovely and cooling to use as well. Not sure if it has helped my blackheads though but for the money it's worth a try."
"not harsh -suits my skin, and cruelty free, perfect"
Should try this oneAwesome 👏
visible results
I like the fact that it doesn’t leave a sticky residue on my skin like so many other popular brands.
"Third time I’ve purchased this product. This is the best!! I also bought the makeup remover in the same brand and both work great on my face/skin. I have dry, sensitive skin and this is the first product I’ve found that works great."
I use this a toner after washing my face.  it smells just like rose water.  I've used Dickenson's since high school before a no alcohol version.  I prefer this type.  It leaves my skin soft and ready for the next step in my routine.
"I pick at my skin and needed a gentle toner to use just to make sure all of my make up is off. Really helped get my barrier back healthy, didn’t strip skin at all. Smell is strong."
"Has an interesting smell, which is to be expected with the witch hazel but can’t complain because it works! I’ll use an oil cleanser to remove make up, next face wash and then this toner and I swear I thought my skin was clean until I used this! Clears out the gunk and leftovers that you didn’t know existed! Gentle on the skin and non-drying! Highly recommend for my sensitive skin girlies!"
I use this frozen every morning rub all over my face to tone and help with under eye swelling
I've always used Dickenson's Witch Hazel as a facial toner but the added rose water makes me love the product even more. My skin feels fresh and clean after using it in the evening.
Has a wonderful rose scent. Face feels soft and clean. Love it!
I've been using this for years as a toner every morning and/or evening. It's gentle and effective for removing residual dirt & oil after cleansing or just rinsing face with water.
"Put this witch hazel in a ""misting"" bottle (not a spray, that's too wet) and use it to mist your toilet paper.  You can dilute it 50% with previously boiled water and you now have Wet Wipes that soothe anything you've got going on down there and will definitely NOT mess with your plumbing.  This same mist works well with itching from skin barrier issues and helps clean up excess sweating in skin folds.  With the aloe, it's a real relief."
Excellent and refreshing used as a cleanser on face
"Meine empfindliche Haut verträgt das Gesichtswasser sehr gut. Ich benutze es abends und morgens dann ein Rosenwasser. Seitdem hat sich meine zu Rötungen und Unreinheiten neigende Mischhaut so extrem verbessert, dass ich mittlerweile sogar ohne Make-up das Haus verlassen kann. Daran wäre früher überhaupt nicht zu denken gewesen. Meine Ü50-Haut ist heute wesentlich besser als in jüngeren Jahren."
"El producto duró 8 meses usándolo dos veces al día por lo que considero que la relación calidad - precio es estupenda. Ayuda a hidratar la piel sin dejarla grasosa. En los meses que lo utilicé noté que me ayudó a reducir el tamaño de mis poros en algunas áreas y a controlar la grasa.Tiene un aroma un tanto extraño (cercana al pasto seco) que podría molestar a algunas personas, pero que desaparece unos segundos después de la aplicación.En general es un gran producto para pieles grasas y con acné ya que no causa ardor ni irritación. Lo recomiendo ampliamente."
"Very good for everyday use and reasonably priced, my skin is doing much better, I use it twice a day. Lesser breakouts and it clears up faster too with the product on. What I like about this product is that it's not drying."
"I've been using the Beauty of Joseon Glow Replenishing Rice Facial Sebum Toner for about a month now, and honestly, I'm so glad I found this gem. I have oily-combination skin, and finding a toner that balances my skin without making it feel greasy has always been a struggle. This toner, though, has been a game-changer.The first thing I noticed was how light and refreshing it feels. It's not heavy or sticky like some toners, which is a huge plus for me. After using it consistently, I can genuinely see a difference in how balanced my skin looks. My T-zone isn’t as oily by midday, and my skin feels softer, more hydrated, but never greasy.What I love the most is the fact that it contains rice extract, which adds a subtle glow without clogging my pores or feeling too rich. It feels like my skin is being nourished, not suffocated. And the fact that it’s a Korean skincare product just makes it even better because I’ve always had great experiences with K-beauty products. They just seem to get how to cater to different skin types.If you have oily or combination skin and you’re looking for something that will keep your skin balanced while still giving you that healthy glow, I can’t recommend this toner enough. It’s honestly been a lifesaver for my skin, and I can see myself using this for a long time. It feels like one of those rare products that really deliver on what they promise!"
I absolutely LOVE this toner! Every time I use it my skin is glowing and feels so soft.
Desde la primera aplicación lo amé
"I have normal skin that doesn't get oily  or dry, if I treat it well :), and even though I know rice is usually better for oily skin, I wanted to give it a try as I have a bit of acne that might benefit from it. 5-ish fl oz is a good size, and it lasted me a little less than 2 months before the bottle got empty.I adore the smell of real rice wine, and it feels so authentically Korean especially in the packaging, as does BOJ's brand itself. The rice wine smell is very natural smelling, and reminds me of when fermented rice water for hair and your face was super viral on youtube, pinterest, etc. a few years ago, which I really like and appreciate. This is what sets it apart from the other rice toners imo, that it's made of fermented rice.The advertising campaign with the rice mask has been on point, and totally convinced me to try the two lol. As for the performance, it leaves a finish that is matte (maybe tacky?) to the touch, but leaves a subtle glow on my cheeks, which makes sense, as rice and kaolin clay absorb oil. When I soak a cotton pad and leave it on my face for 30 minutes it provides nice hydration and is comparable to using real rice wine as a sheet mask.Overall: This would definitely be able to do what it's supposed to on oilier skin than mine, but I have really enjoyed it nevertheless. It's not magic, but I think this is a really unique product, and I will repurchase as I absolutely love the sophisticated scent :)"
I have been using this toner for 2 months now and I love it! My skin enjoys the hydration and it has helped even my skin tone
"Left me glowing and easily absorbs into my skin. Had many compliments because of my glow. Someone even asked if I was pregnant because of the clothes to which I denied, but had informed them of my skin care routine. I’m happy with this purchase."

للأسف وصلني منتج ثاني ماسك
I was hesitant to try this. A little pricey but so happy I did. Very worth it and a little goes the long way. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and looking healthy and even. Absolutely love it.
Highly recommended! Works wonders for me as an adult and my teen. Our nyc derm said this is a must as part of daily routines and she  was right. Increase hydration or space out daily use if you get drier skin
I use it as a medium for tretinoin cream. It works really well and I feel like my skin is a little tighter when I include it in my skincare.
It's great for my pores. I have a combination type of skin so this product is great for me.
"I'm a guy... stinks that there was sort of a stigma back in the day about using this kind of product / or that I actually cared; because I wish I had been using this since HS. My skin looks probably better in my early 40's than it did in my 20's or 30's, and I'd have to say this is a major reason why. I was already moisturizing for a good 4-5 years but once I started using a toner, especially this one, it just gave my skin new life."
The most important part of my face skincare routine.
"I’ve used this for a month-morning and night.  I’ve seen no difference at all in my pores and in fact my T zone is just as oily as before I use it.  Bummer is I missed the return window for the second bottle. Like I said, I bought into the hype and thought I was getting a great deal so I bought two - now I’m kicking myself. Going back to good ol’ cheap witch hazel."
"It's a small bottle, so it's great for trying out. It's a great product, and I will definitely be buying the bigger bottle."
Súper bien lo recomiendo
"I love all of Paula’s choice products. I’m 54 and still have acne, as well as wrinkles and developing brown spots 🙄. I was in Acutane in my 20’s and now have some basil cell cancer on my nose so my face is a full conundrum as to which products to use over the years. I gave her products a try a few years ago and love everything, I just wish Amazon sold her whole line of products. I would highly recommend any product for any skin type!"
Recommended.
Always wanted to try this and I ended up giving it a go and I think it’s made a difference to my skin!
"J'ai cherché à quoi sert une lotion tonique, puis j'ai cherché quel tonique acheter, puis je suis heureuse d'être tombé sur paula choiceIl y a des résultats assez vite, je suis agréablement surpriseJe recommande"
"This toner smells nice, and makes me feel like I have really clean skin after washing my face."
I like this brand  I use toner 2x a day after washing my face.  You would be surprised at what comes off your face after washing it
Bought it many times and my husband loves it.
Works good
I like this freshener for my face. I have dry skin.
Value for your money
"No kidding, you could pour this toner into a spray bottle and wear it as a body spray. (That is how strong the scent from this product is!!!!) It makes my skin feel nice but even after spraying my face with thermal water, I still smell the scent of this product. It is just not natural to me to have that much fragrance in a product meant to go on your face. I have used the more expensive version of this product and while it was also scented, it was definitely much more subtle. Love the feel but the scent is just beyond overbearing. I will not purchase again unless they do something about all that fragrance. I kid you not, it's like using perfume as a toner!"
Excelente para mis adolescentes
Buscaba justo este hidratante con la consistencia especita y con un olor delicioso. Me gusta cuando traen este tipo de espesor el líquido porque siento que deja la piel suave y como terciopelo.
"Muy buen producto , refresca bastante el cutis"
"Su aroma es muy rico, después de lavar mi cara lo aplico para terminar de limpiarla y me funciona muy bien."
"He estado usando este toner unos días pero siento que tiene mucha fragancia, aunque el precio me parece muy bien porque fueron dos, tarda un poco en secar pero en general bien."
Loción esté limpia pero es muy suave con la piel
"I have a wonderful esthetician & after I see her, my face glows & is so clean.  My nose & surrounding area always gets congested (her words) in between visits so after my last visit I did a google search on how to prevent that congestion & learned salicylic acid will help.  THAYERS is a brand I trust & their salicylic acid toner is truly working - it's gentle & thorough.  I use it only on & around my nose, usually in the morning but sometimes evening as well - I use their Rose Petal over the rest of my face."
"I very rarely write reviews on products, but this one is so great I have to say something. Since I’ve started using this toner my skin is noticeably clearer and brighter, also less oily. Blackheads on my nose have completely disappeared. For a skincare product this has definitely changed the game for me. Awesome!"
"If you’ve struggled.. you might try this. It is refreshing and really seems to work for me. Once at night, and in the morning -if you wish. It is non drying/non irritating. Make sure you shake the bottle a little first. I’ve been using it for months and am very pleased. The bottle lasts for several months so is economical. Hard to find in stores."
I tried this toner and really liked it!My skin became much smoother and lighter.
"With just a week's use of Thayer's, the visible pores on my chin and nose are smaller and cleaner and my skin is smoother than in decades. I'm 70 and find the Thayer's to be a bit drying, but my sunscreen hydrates and lubricates enough to compensate. I had used a big brand toner for many years but this is much better than that one."
"I bought this for my daughter. Her skin was breaking out in spite of seeing a dermatologist. Believe it or not, this worked and stopped the breakouts! Needless to say, I have also bought it for her sister! Don’t hesitate to try it!"
Nice size
"My son has a lot of blackheads and asked me to order something to help. This toner works better than anything he’s used and within a day of using twice a day, his face is clear and smooth. He swears by this product and I do too. He now has a good face care routine"
"I absolutely love Thayer’s products. I live by the facial mist and keep one at home, the office and in my car. Cucumber & lavender are my favorite blends with the coconut coming in a close 3rd. The only thing that would make me love it more is if it came in a glass bottle."
I love how easy it is to apply this product throughout the day as a pick-me-up! It’s very refreshing and the unscented version is perfect for my sensitive skin. I’ve also noticed that it helps reduce oil build up as the day progresses.
"This rose toner has been a staple for a decade, and now the spray mist makes it easier to use. Love the rose smell, and this is so great for your skin!"
"Es bueno, no noto mucha diferencia pero si una mejoria"
It makes my face feel good. Never thought I be the one using this stuff. I carry it everywhere in bag. Love the smell of it. Bought the rose pedal one to. Will buy plenty more.
Love my Thayer's facial mist! I've been using it for years now just spritzing on after my shower and letting absorb while I'm getting dressed and before doing my makeup.. my little sister came for a visit and she used it for the few days that she was here and loved the results of how it moisturized her face that she now uses it to! And I now have my grandchildren using the acne lemongrass Spritz!
This is my first time purchasing it. I was worried that it will ruin my skin since I have a sensitive skin. But it works petfectly fine for my skin and it smells good too! My new fav toner!
"This works awesome! I use everyday once or twice. It’s the only product I use now! I used to have a whole skin routine of every “amazing product” but i just was tired of wasting money on stuff. I do use an acne cleanser as well if I wore makeup that day, but I hardly ever wear makeup now anyway. Everyone says I have nice skin. (Some acne marks from picking as a teen which if you are a teen please never do) I do get a facial twice a year, and they say my skin is really good too!"
"I an using this product for more than 3 years, I can tell my skin is much better than before. It helps to remove the dirt and skin feels very fresh."
Una bruma refrescante para tonificar el rostro.
I have used this product for years & liked Amazon’s pricing. If people would just research what products they use on their skin?? I like that it now has aloe Vera in it. I add a bit of rose water for an extra kick. It’s a toner with many other benefits that you can use everyday.
"I’m happy with the product. Initially I thought it was a regular screw top bottle but it’s a facial mist, which works just as well."
"This product is sold out in most retailers like boots, so it was really happy to find it listed here and double the size of what I usually get! Would buy again"
"I can’t say enough good things about the Anua Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner! This has become a must-have in my skincare routine.Gentle and Soothing: From the first use, I noticed how gentle and soothing this toner is. The heartleaf extract really helps calm my skin, especially on days when it feels irritated or sensitive.Hydrating Formula: It provides a great boost of hydration without feeling heavy or greasy. My skin feels plump and refreshed after applying it, making it perfect for prepping my face for serums and moisturizers.Lightweight Texture: The lightweight texture absorbs quickly, leaving no sticky residue behind. I can use it in the morning before my makeup and at night as part of my skincare routine without any issues.Great for All Skin Types: As someone with combination skin, I appreciate that this toner is suitable for all skin types. It’s been effective for me without causing any breakouts or irritation.Final Thoughts: If you’re looking for a soothing toner that hydrates and refreshes, I highly recommend the Anua Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner. It’s a fantastic addition to any skincare routine, and I’ll definitely be repurchasing!"
"I recently added the Anua Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner to my routine, and it’s been a game-changer! With a perfect pH 5.5, it gently balances my skin without causing any irritation. It’s amazing how calming and soothing it feels, especially when my skin is acting up. The toner is also incredibly hydrating and leaves my skin feeling fresh and plump. I love that it’s vegan and cruelty-free, so I feel good about using it. Plus, it’s a great size at 250ml, which lasts a long time. If you’re looking for a toner that’s purifying, refreshing, and ideal for troubled skin, I highly recommend this one!"
"I've recently switched to an Anua skincare routine and I'm a big fan of every product I've tried so far. I use the Anua brand oil cleanser, foam cleanser, toner, serum, and moisturizer and there's a noticeable difference in the size of my pores, my skintone has evened out, and my skin feels softer.This toner is nice, it's very lightweight and absorbs into your skin super fast."
"This toner is very hydrating. I recommend this toner because it's a staple in my routine. After cleansing once in the morning, it provides extra hydration/ removes residue from the skin. I use cotton rounds with this toner but it can be used be itself and patted into the skin. It is approved for acne-prone/ combination/ teen/skin that tends to experience redness from actives. While it may be a bit pricey compared to drugstore toners it's a good investment for clear, happy, healthy skin."
Great addition to my face care routine!It’s a great toner that was introduced to me by a friend.I can see a night and day difference when using this!
"Not sponsored ofc but I want to clear something up! So many people, have the conversation that this is just water. I would have to strongly disagree because you have to use it for what it is attended for. For me, I do have breakouts every so often. I need something to calm it down. If you’re looking to use this for any other reason, even moisture, I would say that it is lacking. However, for a first step toner, I think it pairs very well. I think it’s important to know that not only does is pair very well with other products, it is very lightweight so that it doesn’t cause peeling later on down the line. I personally pair this with an essence directly after putting this on my skin. I don’t have a lot of inflammatory products and if I do have breakouts, using this helps to calm and soothe those big breakouts. Of course, if you use this product, and then pair with something that inflames you later on, you would think it’s not working it can only do so much because you also need to have a good skin care regimen that does not break you out, and that works for your skin. As someone who typically has dry skin, I would say this is a staple. I’ve already purchased this multiple times, I believe this is my current third bottle and I am still in love. Again, I do use a essence on top of it to provide me with the moisture, but in terms of prepping the skin for skin care, I wouldn’t use any other products because I love this that much. This alone will not cause a miracle but once you get a good routine and base you would love it!"
"I use this in conjunction with the Anua Heartleaf Oil Cleanser and I really like the duo. I follow the oil cleanser with a gentle cleaner and then periodically use the toner. If my skin is a little dry, I skip the toner but I wouldn't say the toner itself is drying (I just have super sensitive skin). The fact that I can use this toner at all attests to the fact that it is gentle. My skin has really evened out and become much healthier since I started using the Anua products. I am 44 years old with combination, sensitive skin."
"This is a very good toner but the last bottle I purchased began to smell like vinegar and then it was irritating my skin badly. My skin became insanely dry over night to the point my skin cracked open and bled. No idea why the product went bad or whatever, my apartment is not hot, it’s autumn now as I am writing this, I didn’t mistreat the product in any way, maybe it was just a fluke but if you go to use this and it smells like vinegar, throw it away!!!!"
Soothing and worth the buybif youre looking for a gentle toner to clear up dullnes on the face.
It feels to light and after 2 use I feel my skin so soft and the texture is also smooth.
"comprato in seguito a molte raccomandazioni e devo dire che mi ha stupita, non mi ha fatto irritazioni alla pelle anche se è molto sensibile"
Den är väldigt bra och ger glow. Gillar den så länge
"According to youtube, it is the orignal one as bubbles form once shaken."
"I have a skin problem where my face is ALWAYS dry and flaky no matter what i do. This works pretty well to exfoliate & doesn’t dry my face out more than it already is, which is a plus!"
Super hydrating and exfoliating  Helped improve my skins surface and even out skin tone.  Works well with the CosRx snail mucin line.
"I love the serum & moisturizer! I have dry skin so when I tried spraying it on a cotton pad to lightly wipe/press on my face it was too harsh for my skin, burning and peeling. I’m able to lightly spray on my face, but I’m not quite sure it's even working that way. I still love this brand."
I like that the toner is a spray it’s easy on the skin and dries quick. I have combo skin and have been using this for a few months and it doesn’t break me out
"This product will truly transform your skin. If you’re looking to achieve porcelain baby soft skin, this is a must have! After cleansing I apply and use morning and evening, even as a refresher during the day ! Calm skin completely gets rid of pores and blemishes. Consistency is key ! You won’t regret this purchase. I will forever be buying this product. I even carry it in my purse to refresh during the day. The results I have seen after a couple of days are life changing. You won’t regret buying this !! Hope this helps !"
Very light and not harsh
"I replaced my first one right after opening because of the scent, but the second one came same. So I gave it a try with the snail essence, nothing special. Didn't notice any change on my face from daily use of 2 months."
I started to use it and I like it so far
Exfoliante suave y efectivo… lo utilizo por las noches en días alternados  👍🏻
"I am an oily sensitive skin girl, so i do have to check precisely before applying anything on my skin. I like minimal products in my skincare so i wanted a toner which can do more than just control sebum. Then i came across this gem and i am happy that i bought it. I bought it for 660 something on sale and I saying it is worth every rps, the quality is 150 ml i am using it twice a day and it is gonna last 3-4 more months. I am posting this review after using it for 2 weeks and my skin has less sebum, no tiny bumps and no open pores. It has lightnen my dark acne marks and i think the skin texture has also slightly improved. Regular use will show the better results. I am goning to stick to it.❤️The packaging was nice no damage or leakage of the product."
"Tengo un mes usandolo y he notado mi piel mas suave y con menos apariencia de poros, me ayudo con la descamación y con la grasa de la piel.ALGO IMPORTANTE A RESALTAR: Tengan cuidado con la purga de piel, los primeros tres dias me salio mucha textura que no tenia antes, pero es una reacción normal a los componentes porque esta depurando la piel. No es malo ya que se ira en menos de una semana y saldra la piel bonita. 💕"
Gives my skin a refreshing feeling.
Nice
"When I tell you my face feels so clean and healthy, I can’t express it enough. It smells so clean and good. It does AMAZING at cleansing and shrinking your pores but never leaving your pores feeling dry and tight in an unhealthy way. You can literally feel the immediate clean sensation of your pores while leaving your skin still feeling so healthy and plump."
bought for my daughter and she loved it
I have used this for years. It has kept my skin healthy and glowing. I keep a fresh bottle for weekly maintenance since I don't use it daily anymore. This stuff is great and extremely gentle and it was the gateway for me to their other products. Very satisfied customer. Recommended.
"I really like this toner, my 4 stars is only due to the price, as we are purchasing it for a preteen and uses it up quickly."
This product is helpful even for aging skin.  I use it in my daily routine and my skin feels soft.  I get compliments on my glowing skin.  Plus a little goes a long way.
I generally dislike toners as I break out a lot. Decided to give this a try. This has not broke me out once and I love the softness and pleasant smell. My skin also feels and looks great
This is so refreshing and feels wonderfully when patted on! So refreshing! I have dry skin
I love the smell of it and it cleans out my pores very well!!
beste Makeup Unterlage!
perfect
I loved it I already went to sephora and already have loads of then but I have all of the preppy skincare so I Deffo recommend
it smells a bit funky like it still smells but it makes my skin glow and it works
Dear this bottle bot properly packed and leak at the time of delivery
"I don’t need a lot of product for each use, leaves my face feeling very light & refreshed. I use it with a cotton pad. Not sticky in the slightest. my skin takes it very well, I have combination skin and it accommodates to every inch of my skin, leaves a clean, moisturized finish. Calms down flaking red patches of skin overnight. Durable and great performance."
"Other than the Cica (cantella asiatica) that is in this mist, there are actually two other soothing ingredients: Panthenol (a humectant which is also used for barrier repair) and Allantoin (another humectant that protects skin and promotes wound healing). Other than that, there is Sodium Hyaluronate (another form of hyaluronic acid) and Betaine (another skin protectant and humectant).  A lot of people spray their face with water before they apply serums so more moisture can be brought into their skin by their serums, and to ensure their serums absorb deeper- except I use this instead of water. That way I can also fix my skin irritation at the same time. This stuff has only 5 ingredients other than water so it’s light enough to do so. I also think that for that reason there is no way this stuff can break you out. So essentially this is always my next step after toner. But this spray only has one ingredient that kind of acts as an emollient in its formula (it’s mainly a solvent) and the rest of the ingredients are humectants. Because of this I’m pretty sure that if you spray this on your face AFTER putting on lotion, oil, or makeup, there is a high chance the “hydration” it provides will literally only be those 20 seconds your face is wet with the product- and when it dries, your skin will still be at the same level of hydration as it was before. So I’m shocked people are using it that way. I don’t think there are enough ingredients in it that can retain the moisture the humectants capture. But if you like that refreshed feeling with a little bit of soothing power instead of something that can actually rehydrate your skin then keep using it that way- IMO, other than using this to increase the level of hydration my serums give me, I think this is a good way to calm the skin without having to use an entire serum to do so, which allows me to use my other serums that target anti aging or brightening instead."
Reduces irritation on skin and feels moisturizing. Smells nice.
Good quality
I like that this comes in a spray bottle because sometimes I’m too lazy to use a cotton pad or my hands (also my hands get eczema sometimes) so this is convenient. My skin loves centella and this is very soothing and hydrating.
This product is great. I was able to see a difference after only a week of use. this works great with my other COSRX Products.
"refreshing but honestly I don't feel like it does anything, I don't see any changes"
I love that it is an easy mist. I use it twice a day and it comes down any irritation on my face
"Me llego el producto hace unos días y ya he empezado a utilizarlo, tengo que decir que es fantástico, yo sufro de rojeces(no acné) y piel reseca con principios de rosácea, para tranquilizar mi piel usaba óxido de zinc por las noches y era magnífico, sin embargo es un producto pesado y molesto, además de solo poder usarlo por las noches, ningún otro producto me calma la piel cuando incluso me empieza a arder, por lo que quería algo que pudiera usar en la mañana y noche sin problema, sin ser tan pesado, con este tónico me he aplico en las mañanas y noches, ha sido fantástico mi piel no tiene rojeces, la deja totalmente calmada y puedo combinarlo con mi rutina diaria de skin care ❤️ Amo completamente, cuando lleve mas meses utilizándolo haré un update de este producto"
"I’ve noticed a significant difference with my skin after using this product. My skin is softer and it just feels extra moisturized. I love that I can just spray it on my skin or use the product with a cotton pad. Overall, a great purchase."
It’s refreshing on the skin
This is what I call the Magical potion to make you looking good and makes your face relaxed and hydrated.
It's very good toner calming also for my sensitive skin
"9/14/24- I discovered on TikTok. Has a light tea tree oil scent, No big deal. Use daily, very small amount as a toner. Almost 7 days and I feel the difference in my skin. Texture on skin is different, tighter and much much smoother. I bought this after a major breakout. Scarring and dark spots are present but it wasn’t due to the toner but definitely has helped calm my skin and stop further breakouts in my jawline. I’m excited to see if this product continues to improve my skin. Will come back for update. My skin is used to harsher products so I suspect daily use is ok for my skin. Suggest start slow for those that aren’t used to the chemicals.Update- this has not caused breakouts and has continued to improve my skin. I now use it as daily toner, small amount. I had one or 2 pimples and I noticed because of the toner use, it helped dry out quicker. I suspect it’s the tea tree in the solution too!!"
"I do not use abrasive exfoliants on my face so I always look for BHA toners. Previously I’ve tried ones that left my skin feeling over dry. This one is just right. My skin looks and feels so much better, and it makes my skin tingle a little! (Key word TINGLE, not BURN!) I use it about 2-3 times a week and it really helps manage my oily skin and moisturize my dry skin."
"I happened across this product while looking for a toner, thought it sounded good. Would it deliver though? It certainly did as promised. I was having break outs on my face, always had clear skin, was not a happy time. Within a few weeks, I truly mean this, my face is clear. Happy days are here again."
I got this to try to calm my rosacea flare ups and also help my pores. It did not really do either. I like that it does not have a sticky feeling after it dries and goes on nicely but it was not helpful for me.
"I absolutely loved this toner! Yes, I used it all in just a month but, it is so refreshing, soothing and gentle. I used this morning and night as part of my Korean skincare routine. This was my first some by me product but, I plan on reordering this toner along with other products and can't wait! It is like rubbing a pure essence of cucumber, tea tree and mint. I really loved how fresh this made my face feel!"
Great product and worth the money
I’m using this toner since 6 months..This toner help me to reduce and tighten pore and exfoliate my skin without drying ..I just love it so much
"I have very oily skin, and was looking for something that I could get some cleaning action out of as well as to remove the rest of the cleanser and any remaining make up to the point to remove oil from my skin and leave it feeling clean. I didn’t get this out of any of the products that I bought I don’t think this is a toner as you leave it on as a treatment and you just pad it on I think it’s a toner as a toner is meant to be and for me it didn’t perform that way. My skin still felt like there was oil and dirt on it ."
"Me gusto mucho como deja la piel. He probado con jabones y sueros, con los componentes juntos e individuales y mi piel no los tolera, ni siquiera la niacinamida sola, de porcentaje bajo. Dentro de poco la barrera cutánea se rompe, no importa si cambio las cantidades o la frecuencia, el resultado es el mismo.Tenía esperanza con este suero, ya que he visto que es gentil con la piel y aunque yo no tengo acné, mi piel es delicada.He visto muy buenos resultados, tengo menos puntos negros, que era lo que quería tratar, y mi piel en general tiene un tono uniforme, se ve brillante y jugosa después de hidratar. Otra cosa que noté es que el efecto tiene una duración bastante prolongada a diferencia de los jabones con hidroxiácidos o mascarillas.Finalmente, mi piel sí ha sufrido cambios, pero mayormente positivos. Tengo pequeñas descamaciones por aquí o por allá, pero, considero que ha sido gracias al periodo de adaptación al producto, ya que lo he aplicado con menor frecuencia y estas desaparecieron como era de esperarse; sin embargo, la presentación de mi piel en general no cambió al no usar diariamente el producto, siguió siendo muy buena.En verdad me gustó mucho, lo recomiendo."
كويس وأعتقد بأنه الأصليماخرب مع الشحن حلو نفس اللي بالصيدليه نتايجه مره احبه وهو باقي المنتجات من البراند
"I recently purchased this product, and I’m thoroughly impressed. It exceeded my expectations in both performance and quality, delivering exactly what was promised."
"Its amazing! Especially when used after the bye bye blackhead facial cleanser , i give it 10/10"
Tighten the pores
"Update: I reorder this whenever I am out - I love what it does to and for my skin. They also have a ginseng/snail mucin mix that works so well for my rosacea redness. If I use CosRX centella asiatica toner, then this ginseng essence, and top it off with either CoxRX snail mucin or the BOJ ginseng/smail mucin, my skin is not only glowing with a healthy glow, but the redness is very much calmed down! That's all I have on my face as I write this and my skin feels wonderful. I will add some retinoid and/or moisturizer later.Love it!--------------------This is my first try of Beauty of Joseon and I would definitely try other products from this brand. My skin loves K-beauty, and as well I often find some K-beauty brands are not as pricey. This one is reasonably priced and a little goes a long way so that makes the value better as well.I love how you have to 'shake out' a bit of the essence so that it isn't wasted - not to much comes out at a time and you don't need much. A few shakes onto my palm and I pat and then press the essence onto my skin. Patting and pressing works better than trying to 'rub' it onto the skin.I do a multi-step routine - since I work remotely, I have the time to take my time. I cleanse and immediately use a toner--though this is both essence and toner, right now I have a separate milky toner. I sometimes apply this essence right after toning or I'll wait 10-15 minutes. I wait another 15 minutes or more and then comes my vitamin c. Waiting between each product allows it time to absorb into my skin (at least this is what my research indicates). It also gives my skin time to settle down between products. I apply my serums and moisturizers, and SPF last when I'm leaving the house.Essences are mostly water and that's what they are supposed to be so don't expect something thicker or emollient. Essences are made to go on early in your routine, after cleansing, whether you use them as a toner or just an added step after toning as I'm doing right now until my milky toner runs out and then I will use this as one step toning and essence and see how that goes.I have rosacea-prone skin and there is zero irritation or redness, no burning or itchy feeling. My skin tolerates this essence very well. It leaves my skin looking bright and refreshed.There is 2% Niacinamide included, which is a form of vitamin B and though it's a small amount, it's still a powerhouse ingredient.Ginseng is known for its anti-aging qualities, inflammation reducing, and brightening for the skin.I'm happy with my order."
"Honestly surprised by this product because it makes my skin glow so much.I ordered this toner not knowing what it would exactly do to my skin but it actually hydrates my skin a lot. I used to only put moisturizer thinking it was enough for my dry skin, but I would wake up with a dry skin skin. This toner regulates the moisture and keeps my skin hydrated 24/7. The texture is very light too so it does not feel heavy when you have a long skincare routine.Recommend!"
"I have never used a hydrating serum at night and decided I wanted more moisturizing items in my routine that wouldn't be too heavy and I wanted something that was sensitive and acne prone safe. I decided to go with this one since it is supposed to be hydrating and has niacinamide in it. I've been using it for a few weeks and I'm very happy with the hydration it gives me at night before going to bed. I pat it in gently and follow with my moisturizer and retinol. It is refreshing and my skin has had no irritation to it. There is a slight scent, but it doesn't bother me at all. I also love that it's going to last for such a long time and only takes a few drops to use on your face and neck."
"If you have dry skin like I do, I don't know if I would recommend this. It's hydrating but not hydrating enough for my skin in particular, which can be extremely dry. It's very calming though so if you have skin inflammation or red skin, I think this toner would help a lot! It helps with keeping my skin clear and soft, and it's very lightweight so it's easy to layer products on top of it."
i’m already halfway through the bottle and i’ll be getting more. as soon as i apply it my skin already has a shiny glowy hue. the texture is like water and smells like a plant. it absorbs well in my skin.
"I really do not do reviews but in this case I feel like I have to, to warn people have sensitive skin to be careful if they want to try this skincare line. I ordered my first beauty of Joseon last year I got the ginseng toner, the cleanser and the serum that goes with it. Up on using the product I felt that my skin is healthy and glowing and clear then it have ever been. And to make it clear I have a hyper sensitive skin and on top of that I have eczema so my skin can flare up anytime if it wants to or if I use something that irritates it. Since I use the products for a year everything was doing fine everything was perfect I'm loving the product there's no problem with it my skin is loving it not until the beginning of this year all of a sudden my face broke out. My face started to itch I thought it was just itchy but when I look at it on the mirror I see some redness on my skin and some rash, so basically my face was flaring up but I did not blame it to the skincare that I was using because like I said a year prior everything was perfect so I thought it's just my skin doing its thing and it's going to go away. So I stopped using the skin care line until my face was fully healed so that was about June when my face finally healed from the flare-up that I had from the beginning of the this year. I didn't use the toner because I ran out, but I still have the oil based cleanser and I'm being using it on and off and my face is okay it didn't flare up it no allergic reaction or anything like that. decided to reorder the toner Plus the light vitamin C serum and got delivered yesterday, so I opened up the new bottle of toner and the vitamin C light serum and use it exactly at 9:40 p.m.. but when 3:00 a.m. came left corner of my lips was kind of itchy so I checked it out on the mirror and it was red and I was praying in my heart that it wasn't from the toner and the term that I used prior before going to work. But as the morning progress the T-Zone area on my face flared up now it have a full-blown allergic reaction it have this small type of rash and it's red and it's itchy. So I am sad to say I am discontinuing using the toner and serum. before knowing that the cause of my previous allergic reaction was this skin care line I reordered the snail serum as well because I was using that last year and I really like the results. Now I'm sad because not only did I feel like I wasted my money now I don't know what to do with this brand new products especially the snail serum that is going to be delivered tomorrow. So in conclusion for all of the people who have sensitive skin and their skin can be easily irritated please be careful before buying this or any type of skin care. Just make myself clear I'm not saying the product is not good because like I said I love the product and it worked on me last year when i got it."

"This is my honest and very detailed review of the Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner 180ml. I received  this on February 6 2017, and I bought it from the seller Wishtrend. My product was not counterfeit and the shipping was fast because I have Prime. I have been using it for about 4 months now. This product is amazing. If you wish to read the full details of my review please keep reading. I hope this review helps someone :).Pros/ Good:1. Hydrating for a toner!2. Very gentle, it is gentle enough that it didn't irritate my sensitive acne prone skin3. Seems to be great for all skin (my mom and sister tried it and they have different skin then me)4. No fragrance ( artificial fragrance is especially not good for the skin)5. Layers well with other products6. Fast absorbing7. Seems to do what is advertised8. Get a good amount of product for the price9. Packing is simple and nice, and it dispenses well10. My other products seem to absorb better and with no peeling with this tonerCons/ Bad:1. The price may be a turn off to some because it is not exactly really low cost2. Some that like simple ingredient list may not like the long ingredient list this product has ( I don't mind).My skin type: I have dry, sensitive skin that is prone to mild acne. My skin reacts terribly to harsh chemicals and fragrances. I have always had clear skin in my teens but for some reason saw mild acne bumps occur on my cheeks ( small 3-4 of them) and I am in my 20s. Sometimes I would get 1-2 deep, pus filled zits. My skin has gotten a lot better since 2 months of use and this has helped ( though not the main reason). To make clear this did not clear up my acne but it did help because hydrated skin is happier skin. What helped my acne overall were probiotics ( and sugar free yogurt) and switching to a low refined carbs and sugar diet, I also consume more fruits and veggies when I can because eating clean is expensive.The Package: I think it is important to pay attention to packaging when purchasing skin care products. The toner comes in a brown cardboard box.  The front has an image of the toner, and the coloring is brown and purple with black ink. The writing is in black ink for the majority of the package. The writing is in Korean and english. It states the location of manufacturing. The bottle is made of plastic and is a very dark brown with a black plastic top. The label is placed on the actual bottle and is a ivory or off white color. The text is in Korean and english. It dispenses like a drip, so one drop at a time. It looks legitimate and none counterfeit from my research. Please research all your skincare before purchase.The ingredients list: Main ingredients- sodium hyaluronate, glucan, centella asiatica extract, lipidureOther ingredients: water, butylene glycol, dimethyl sulfone, betaine, caprylic/caprice triglyceride, natto gum, sodium hyaluronate, disodium EDTA, centella asiatica extract, glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) root extract, polyquaternium-51, chlorphenesin, tocopheryl acetate, carbomer, panthenol, arginine, luffa cylindrica fruit/leaf/stem extract, beta-glucan, althaea rosea flower extract, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, hydroxyethylcellulose, portulaca oleracea extract, lysine HCL, proline, sodium Ascorbyl phosphate, acetyl methionine, theanine, lavandula angustifola (lavender) oil, eucalyptus globulus leaf oil, pelargonium graveolens flower oil, citrus limon (lemon) peel oil, citrus aurantium dulcis (Orange) peel oil, cananga odorata flower oil, copper tripeptide-1How I use it: I do not use this with a cotton pad or a cotton ball because cotton absorbs a lot of the product causing one to use more. If you think you have extra make up on your face and want to wipe it off just incase then a cotton pad/ball would be recommended. However, I use it mainly as a toner after I know all my make up is gone. I wash my hands, dry them and then use a few drops and gently pat it on my face.My experience: This product is a holy grail! The product dispenses really well so I never use to much. The color is clear, it is pretty much odorless, and the texture is a little viscous and not really watery, and none sticky. Like I stated before I have dry skin. I often get dry flaky spots in the winter. I have used toners before and they were all watery and drying. Most toners have an alcohol smell and some irritated my skin or dried it out worst like CosRx toner. I switched to Klairs toner after seeing great reviews. I was skeptical, and the price was not the cheapest if it did not work but I was desperate for hydration so took the risk. I do not regret it! This is as hydrating as a toner can get. It leaves my skin smooth and not tight. It is fast absorbing and layers beautifully under products and no peeling. It does what it advertises and helps remove extra make up. I also notice my products absorb better into my skin when I use this toner, they absorb faster and do not peel ( I use 4-5 products in my skincare routine, including the cleanser). I cannot believe a toner like this exist! No irritation, no dryness so this is a dream!My family experience: My mother and sister tried this product and both love it! My sister has oily skin and my mom combination skin with oily and dry. My sister has moderate acne. My mom clear skin, sensitive, with a few wrinkles around the eyes ( my mom is in her 40s and my sister is in her 20s). They both had no negative reaction to the toner, and they both said it was hydrating. The toner did not peel and layered well for them. It also helped my sister remove her makeup.Overall: I highly recommend this product. This product does everything it advertises and that is remarkable. It is fast absorbing, layers beautifully, hydrating and helps in the removal of make up, gentle enough for sensitive skin. I can't believe this worked and I hope this works for everyone as well! I hope my review helps someone.Update: 9/1/2018- I am almost done with my second bottle since this review and it is still great. My skin still loves this product and as you can see I have only ever purchased 2 bottles! It last a long time and no one has had any adverse effects in my family. My skin has gotten better over all since my probiotics and cleaner eating ( my acne was mainly inflammatory gut issues) but my skin is still sensitive. I still recommend this product for everyone but again do your research before anything. I have sensitive skin but this has helped me, for those with skin sensitive to essential oils or more sensitive than mine than they also released another version of this that contains no essential oils I believe. I have not tried that yet but hope to some day, but Klairs is expensive so I am not sure if that will be anytime soon, however, I love this product so look forward to buying again. Thank you everyone and if anything some how gets worst I will update this review. I hope this helped some :)"
"This is the 2nd time I've bought this. It has a nice, light scent (also available unscented), and it's refreshing. I bought a less expensive toner, but came back to this one. Worth the cost!"
"For years, my skincare routine was pretty simple: wash my face and moisturize, and slather on sunscreen if I can remember. But as I approached my late 20s, I realized that my skin wasn't looking too great, and I was starting to get fine lines and dry patches. So I decided to add a hydrating toner to my routine. I've used toners before as part of an oil-control/acne regimen, but they were all very drying and irritated my face even with a lot of moisturizer.I have sensitive, slightly acne-prone  combination skin that breaks out in reaction to most drugstore products, so I look for items that do not contain added fragrances or alcohols. My t-zone tends to get oily during the day, while my cheeks dry out. I would usually blot my forehead to get rid of the excess oil, and reapply moisturizer to my cheeks to keep the flakiness away.Klairs toner has a watery to almost gel-like texture that absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any sticky residue. The first time I put it on my face, my skin absorbed it so quickly that I decided to put on a couple more layers, then sealed it all in with moisturizer (I use the oil-free one from Trader Joe's). After a few weeks of this regimen, I noticed that my skin wasn't as oily or dry as it used to be. It turns out I have dehydrated skin, which caused my t-zone to produce more oil to compensate for the lack of moisture. I don't always drink enough water, but since adding Klairs to my routine along with a hydrating sheet mask once or twice a week, my skin is now much softer and smoother to the touch, making makeup easier to apply.Just last week, I forgot to put sunscreen on my face and got a mild burn on my forehead and cheeks. The toner was very gentle and helped to soothe my irritated, sunburned skin. I think the added moisture prevented it from peeling too much.Despite the lack of fragrance, the botanical oils in this toner give it a pleasant scent. The dispenser makes it easy to control the amount you use, so there's no risk of spillage and wasting product. I've been using it for about 3 weeks now, but the bottle still feels completely full so I'm sure it will last for several more months. It also travels well. Just soak cotton pads with the toner and store in a sealed ziploc bag.As with any skincare product, your mileage may vary. This toner may not work for everyone's skincare needs, and I would patch test before regular use to make sure you are not allergic to any of its ingredients. But I am impressed at the improvement in my skin's hydration and texture, and would definitely recommend this product to anyone who also has dehydrated combination skin and is looking for something to rebalance and add moisture back to their skin after cleansing. I would also recommend using a moisturizer after Klairs has soaked into the skin, to help seal in the moisture.Edit (9/19/17):After using this toner more liberally, about 1/5 of the bottle is gone, so it's more accurate to estimate that it will last 4 more months. I still believe this is a great value for the quality of product."
I didnt see any improvement
Makes my skin feel so clean and smooth!
I am 49 years old female with very dry skin.This serum-like toner is good start item for daily skincare routine.It is a very good toner for home facial machine. This toner with any serum works great together.Scentless is one of my favourite thing  as well!!
Deja la piel suave y preparada para recibir serum y crema después
Soothing and refreshingGood for oily skinHelps to calm the skin
Adoro i prodotti coreani....mi trovo benissimo ed anke la mia pelle va meglio
"En verdad que es el mejor Tonico que he probado, te ayuda muchísimo a que tus otras cremas se observan súper bien!"
"Their page says ""Ingredients: Glycolic and Lactic acids blended with Certified Organic Witch Hazel""Their label says:WaterAloe Leaf JuiceVaccinium Myrtillus Fruit ExtractSodium HydroxideWitch Hazel WaterSugarcane ExtractChamomile Flower ExtractSugar Maple ExtractOrange Fruit ExtractOrange Peel OilLemon Fruit ExtractPVPIsoceteth-20Disodium EDTAPropylene GlycolCitric AcidPotassium SorbateSodium BenzoatePhenoxyethanolChlorphenesinLimoneneI am allergic to something in here and never would have bought it if I had known what was in it. But they got me anyway. There's also nothing on the label about any ingredient being organic or ""certified organic."" Oh, well. And citric acid and sodium benzoate combined create benzene. So that's concerning."
Thayers is the best Toner product on the shelf.  Amazon makes it hassle free to order it online and have it delivered straight to my door.
I actually expected the bottle to be glass but it’s not but the product is good. I love the smell of cucumber and it reduces the swelling in my eyes so well
"Only thing I dislike is the smell of this toner, otherwise it is great at removing any leftover trace of makeup and it is very soothing , non irritating. A great prep for your serum and moisturizer!"
Getting old and wrinkles showing horrible.  Started toner moisturizer and see a vast improvement
The only toner I use on my face. Never had an issue.
good product
I love this product.
I've been using this as a facial toner every morning and evening before bed. I apply it after I wash my face and it feels very refreshing and light. I would buy this again for sure.
"This product is perfect. I needed a good toner to minimize my pores, and this toner clears my skin and tightens them. I’m very happy with it and I recommend it."
I use it as aftershave for razor bumps but it's very drying.
I bought this to wipe my face before & after work & showers. I love it. Very refreshing. Keeps skin soft and hydrated. Definitely buying again.
sometimes i get desperate and use it to take off the mascara on the top of my eyelids after i put like 50 coats on and its all over my facei dont really know why i bought this but its come in clutch
"I like this toner, as it's a milky, soothing feel to it, I believe it adds a bit of moisture to my dry skin, before applying the rest of my skin products."
I’ve been using this milky toner for about a month now and I’m absolutely loving it. I’ve definitely seen an improvement in my skin since I started using it in my daily routine. My face feels so soft and looks super smooth. This is a great product would totally recommend it to someone who wants a more moisturizing toner to use.
Works well and the best part is there is no fragrance and no stinging on your face from witch hazel
"It burned a little when I put it on. I'm wondering if maybe that was because I washed my face a bit rough or maybe my sunscreen irritated my skin? I did wear a chemical. I'll try again a few times with a mineral and update. Maybe I just used too much. Maybe it's the snow mushroom or elderberry water. Maybe it's Maybelli-It came with a little tin seal on the bottle so that was nice. I dislike unsealed products.It's very creamy and milky, same consistency as a serum. I don't use pads to wipe it on, I just apply it to my face so it essentially is another serum to me. I got the small bottle first which was about $4 and I can already tell this will last me quite a while. I wanted to try it first before I got the big one. If it continues to burn I may take a pass and try one of the fancy Korean ones. Love the texture though. Really added some extra hydration to my skin.Glycerin is the second ingredient and hyaluronic acid is pretty high up too so I may just stop using my individual serum in this case. Very humectanty."
"This is the least drying toner I’ve ever used.  If anything, my skin is more moisturized after using it than before!  In hot sticky weather it may not be so important ,  but in winter with heat on that dries out your skin it really shows its colors.  And because it comes in both small and large size bottles it’s no great commitment to give it a try."
I apply this on my face after cleansing. It feels luxurious!  My skin immediately feels moisturized and looks healthy. It's hard to describe the fabulous effect it has on my skin. I use it every morning and night after washing my face. I'll never be without this toner!!!
"This product has evened out my complexion and does a really great job cleaning my skin.  I did not even know what toner was before I bought this. Thanks to Kit Price, male model, for recommending it."
"Truth be told, you can't judge a book or a facial cleanser by its cover, and I was drawn in by the guy on the bottle, who reminds me of the Smith Bros. of cough drop fame.  So  guess I was thinking a bit nostalgically about old-timey things. However this is a modern formulation, and at my age I am after moisturizing in all my skin care.  So what can't I settle with about this?  The consistency is strange, kind of watery.  Also it is billed as ""fragrance free"", and I do enjoy the various aromas of my skin care products, but decided I could live without that if I liked the rest of what it did.  What I did not realize is that ""fragrance free"" does not connote no smell and unfortunately this cleanser has a weird chemical smell that I can't ignore.  So while it does its job well enough and has helped my face stay moister I can only think that  could be having similar results with a different  product  that smells better, and I may well return this while it's still in the return time window."
"First, I’m 47, oily with dehydrated skin. I can get away with just a milky toner for my daytime hydration most of the year and this is it. I find it highly hydrating, my skin just drinks it up. It doesn’t accent pores or texture and it does not pill under makeup. My face feels soft and smooth and nicely primed for foundation. If you are drier skinned, I am sure this would sit nicely under a moisturing cream or lotion. I have tried many similar products, including that $80 milky toner sold at the beauty store with the stripes (you know which one I mean) and I think this toner is much better. And you can’t beat the price."
"This is my new favourite face wash! I love the texture - super soft and makes my face feel clean without stripped of natural goodness. Both my husband and I have sensitive skin and neither of us have had any negative reactions after 3 weeks of use. Wish they had more scents, this ones just not the best"
As with all Thayers products this is amazing value for money. Was looking for an alternative to my stand alone hyaluronic acid serum. I use this instead as the first serum after cleansing and it is lovely. A tiny drop goes a long way. It foams a little at first but this disappears upon gently rubbing it in. Leaves my skin feeling plump and refreshed. Layers well. Love it.
"Don’t walk,RUN GET YOURS"
"Es un tónico espeso, por lo que se puede aplicar sin necesidad de algodón, directamente con las manos, como un sérum. Con una pequeña cantidad entre la limpieza y la crema hidratante es suficiente. Tras un tiempo de uso, noto mejor tono de piel, más unificado."
"I love this German brand very much, I have been constantly using products for many years and I am always satisfied"
"this is very soothing to my skin, it helped clear an irritation from a reaction to an eyebrow serum.Also I used it every morning before applying moistener."
This toner smells so good!!! It makes my face feel so fresh too. Not sure about long term improvement it I love it so far
"After using moisturizers religiously for years, I really started to see the point of diminishing returns.  I had used some Dr. Hauschka products in the past and generally liked them, so when I was looking for a new night cream I took another look at Dr. H's product line.  Dr. H does not recommend night creams, as it gets in the way of the skin regenerating itself.  I then went cold turkey on the face creams, even during the day, suffered through the withdrawal of skin that had forgotten how to moisturize itself, and started to use this.  This facial tonic and a light eye cream (for day only) are almost all that I use on my face now.  I use clinique liquid soap to wash my face, and sometimes I use a face cream with sun screen, but otherwise I just use this day and night, and my healthier, more self-reliant skin is much happier for it.  I got a facial for my birthday, and the woman who gave me the facial (who only uses all natural products) was impressed with the quality of my skin and asked what I used.  No joke."
Great face toner.
One of the best toner I’ve ever tried. It has herbal fragrance what I really like. Also it calms irritation really well
This toner feels so luxurious and comforting! It’s signature scent is very nostalgic for me & I will always repurchase!
Really like the way it feels. Smells nicely.I just spray it on my face or use it with cotton ball. Will buy again.
My skin soaks this stuff up. I apply after I wash my face every morning and night. I have sensitive skin and all of their products never make me breakout or give me any kind of trouble. Just ordered my second bottle. The 1 Fl Oz lasted me exactly one month.
My skin feels so much better after the first spray
I’ve only been using this for a week and I already notice a difference in my skin being more hydrated and wrinkles less pronounced.  Will definitely be buying more and the bigger bottle when I run out.
Excellent delivery and product
"A bit expensive for a very tiny bottle, but people seem to LOVE it & their session isn't complete without a spritz of this."
Lot's of moisture with no breakouts
Everything about how it makes my skin look just like I had a facelift.
"After enjoying the Multi Active Toner, I decided to give the Dermalogica Antioxidant Hydramist Toner a try, and I have been pleasantly surprised by the results. My skin looks and feels noticeably firmer and more hydrated. The mist is lighter and easier to apply compared to the Multi Active Toner, which is a significant improvement.The only downside is the scent, which has a clove fragrance. While it's not terrible, I could do without it. In my opinion, skincare products should avoid fragrances altogether. Despite this, the benefits far outweigh this minor drawback, and the Antioxidant Hydramist Toner will definitely become a staple in my routine!"
Leaves my skin so nice and soft! Love it.
absolutely love dermalogica products excellent skin care.
"Idratazione immediata, ottimo antiageing / base, anche prima di siero e crema"
Very refreshing and makes your makeup go on smoother
"Una de las mejores compras que he hecho, es muy bueno, tengo la piel seca y muy delicada, cualquier variación que haga en mi rutina se nota el cambio y este producto es genial, he hidrata perfecto, no me irrita nada y tiene un aroma muy rico :)"
"This goes great with the murad hydrating set I have them all. But regardless even just as a toner alone it does wonders. Use morning and night. Use before moisturizing!!! Toner balances your skins ph level. This particular one is good for sensitive skin, dry skin or aging skin. Licensed esthetician here. Great product. They use in high quality salons, wonderful. Skin feels soft and smooth and never had any reaction. I have sensitive skin so this stuff has been a game changer."
I love the smell and feel of this toner. It makes my skin feel so fresh!
"I truly feel this works. I hate their other product that is supposed to go with this, but this toner is awesome and the spray bottle is amazing"
"This toner is amazing. I use it every morning after a soap & water wash and it leaves my skin smooth and plump. If I'm not going out, I just leave it like that."
This really works well with time
"Hydrating toner, feels great on my face and love the smell!"
"My skin changed a few years ago and I just needed more hydration. I kicked the make-up addiction, and my skin has been thanking me ever since. Yet I was drying out and didn't want to use lotion or oil due to break outs. When the pandemic started, I bought my daughters a couple of beauty sample boxes and Murad was in there. The gel was an instant relief and a little goes a long way even in the dry desert. Then just this year I bought the toner spray. Both work wonders on my combination skin and I do not break out. The only other thing I use once in a while to wash my face besides plain water is a gel face wash. That's it and I am a forever customer to Murad now."
Clean skin
I visibly notice my complexion looks better after using it. I haven't noticed lines or anything like that change but my skin doesn't look dull. I love it
"This toner is the absolute best! I was upset that this product changed its packaging from a sprayer to a pump top, but it still works fantastic and I even placed in the spray bottle. There is a smell to the product, but it's not horrible. Leaves face smooth and looking porcelain. Definitely recommend!"
"I purchased this product for it's content.  After using this product to the finish I did not notice a huge difference. Here are the claims made:-Shrinks and purifies pores - When pores are clogged, they appear bigger because they are easier to spot. InstaNatural toner contains powerful astringents - such as Witch Hazel and Tea Tree Oil - which purify your skin by cleaning and tightening pores, shrinking their appearance**I PERSONALLY DID NOT NOTICE A CHANGE IN MY PORE SIZE-Hydrates and preps skin- Each soothing mist delivers instant refreshment to your face. As your skin is hydrated, the MSM in the formula works to penetrate your pores to increase their elasticity. Your face will become more receptive to absorbing serums, oils, and moisturizers applied thereafter. Our Vitamin C Facial Toner is a great way to prep your skin for your beauty routine**I WILL SAY THAT IT IS VERY NICE PUTTING IT ON AND FEELING LIKE IT IS HYDRATING MY FACE BUT THAT IS ABOUT IT-Combats oily skin - Those with oily skin will also rejoice using this reviving facial toner. The ingredients in InstaNatual toner work to combat and remove excess oil, while restoring your natural pH levels so your skin is balanced. This formula is gentle and suitable for all skin types**I HAVE VERY OILY SKIN WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT.  UNFORTUNATELY I DID NOT NOTICE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE OIL PRODUCTION ON MY FACE :(-Manufacturer Warranty - InstaNatural is proud to back their products with a 100% Lifetime Satisfaction Guarantee Policy. If you are not completely happy with your purchase, just contact us for a full refund - no questions asked.** I WILL ADMIT THAT AFTER USING THE PRODUCT UNTIL THE END THAT I DID NOT CONTACT THE SELLER FOR A REFUND BECAUSE I WAS NOT TOTALLY HAPPY WITH IT.-Contains 100% natural and organic ingredients - Also has Vitamin C, an essential nutrient that is vital to developing skin health and youthfulness. This antioxidant is needed in order for the body to produce collagen, which is what keeps your skin elastic and supple. Vitamin C is a great way to restore a youthful complexion by helping to strengthen your skin to protect and fight against environment factors that speed up the signs of aging. InstaNatural toner also preps pores for serums and moisturizer and is great for men and women.**AS A BIG BELIEVER IN NATURAL AND ORGANIC PRODUCTS AS WELL AS MONITORING PH, I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCTS WITH HOPES MAYBE TOO HIGH.  I DO LIKE THE PRODUCT BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT ""I LOVE IT"""
"I’ve always had a love-hate relationship with toners ranging from questions that I get constantly at work like, “is this really worth it?” “Isn’t my face going to burn from Vitamin C?” And the unsolvable mystery regarding witch hazel and it’s efficacy since It always seems to burn skin on contact. I have worked in Dermatology for around 9 years and I love this product. I apply twice daily, I also use Replenix Green Tea Fortified Cleanser and CeraVe PM lotion, retin-a cream, with a glycolic peel 2-3x per week depending on the amount of breakouts I get on my chin. It sounds like a ton but it’s actually very quick (>2min). Being in Dermatology for so long, I have a pretty good idea of what works for acne, oily, anti-aging skin. As the information state on the packaging, Vitamin C brightens, tones, and refines fine lines. It also helps exfoliate old acne scars (hyperpigmented areas from previous acne bumps) over time.I do feel a little tingling sensation when I apply this toner, but it is not painful. I also spray onto a cotton pad an apply on problematic areas of my face as needed. I have oily Mediterranean skin, there is nothing that will get rid of excess oil/sebum from my skin for over 2 hours... this leaves my skin matte and vibrant for around 4 hours until my inherited skin traits kick back in.This also has Vitamin E and Glycolic Acid in it. Vitamin E is good for cell rejuvenation, maintaining healthy skin and can be used to prevent aging/ increase healing (in some cases) Glycolic Acid is a great exfoliator and helps get rid of those hyperpigmented areas after a pimple has gone away.All that said— I think this is a worthwhIle purchase. You have many options when it comes to skin care and usually the dollar amounts matter the most. This is a very inexpensive helpful option for acne prone, oily, anti-aging skin and will last months. The entire line of InstaNatural seems very effective and wallet friendly. I would highly recommend this product as well as the InstaCare line to my patients."
"I am a man, and I really like this product. I have been using this facial toner for almost 10 yrs, and I will keep using it."
Este producto me funcionó muy bien cuando empece a usarlo. Mi piel es mixta y me estaba ayudando con los poros abiertos pero después de semanas de uso sentía que algo irritaba mi piel. Uso más de 5 pasos en mi rutina y no sabía que me estaba resecando la piel hasta que deje de usar este tónico. Mi piel estaba muy seca y el maquillaje acentuaba la resequedad que tenía. En cuanto empece a usar un tónico hidratante mi piel mejoró. No recomiendo este producto.
"Compré este producto  SIN descuento, así que esta opinión no está condicionada. El formato y la aplicación es súper cómodo, yo uso dos pulverizaciones para la cara. Mi piel es mixta y sensible y no sabía cómo me iría. Cuando lo pones y se va secando se nota un poco de tirantez (al menos yo) pero se va en seguida. Se nota que hidrata y refresca la piel, queda mucho mejor preparada para la crema o el sérum. La cantidad del producto está muy bien en relación con el precio.  He seguido comprando más productos de la linea y de la marca y los recomiendo sin lugar a dudas."
Molto buono è un tonico diverso da molti in commercio è una lozione speciale molto molto delicata..una carezza sul viso!!!consiglio vivamente!
"Ce produit est vraiment génial. L'odeur est tres agréable et je l'utilise comme lotion démaquillante, comme tonique, et pour hydrater ma peau en complément de  mes soins habituels. Il est à base de vitamine C et de plus il ressère les pores. Je l'ai adopté."
"My skin type:- Very Dry, easily dehydrated- Oily nose- Prone to stubborn acne and closed comedones- Redness on chin and cheeks (not rosacea)I already use a nightly Tretinoin cream (.04% concentration) to help with my acne and premature signs of aging but decided with my derm that incorporating a BHA would be a good idea to help with my seriously stubborn closed comedones and some irritating textural issues. It was between this and the Cerave SA lotion and I ultimately decided on this due to the higher concentration of salicylic acid.It's moisturizing, and feels sticky for the first 5-10 minutes after application but seems to sinks in to something of a satin finish on me and I can no longer feel it on my skin. You just have to be a little patient. My skin feels well hydrated and plump after it settles and looks really smooth and my pores aren't as obvious. It sits just fine under makeup for me but I'm not a new user to chemical exfoliants so I don't have lots of dead skin pilling up or sloughing off when I use it, my skin is, for the most part, already very smooth outside the acne and CCs. Occasionally I'll apply it further down my neck/decolletage than usual and WOW do I old skin just ball up and peel right away - it's so gross but also satisfying. So those that don't exfoliate often or are new to BHA/AHAs will likely have issues with foundation until their skin adjusts (but it will adjust). My advice in those cases is to either use this at night for the first few weeks or just accept going barefaced for a little while if you can.I'd strongly suggest not applying this product over anything that you feel does not dry down fully, the times I've attempted to use it after serums or heavier products it takes forever to sink in and sometimes never fully does. I save all my serums and essences for after this has absorbed and it's far easier to work with it as a result. My steps go like this most days: ACWell Licorice toner --- PC 2% BHA --- 10% Niacinamide serum --- TO Matryxil serum --- Secret Key Black Snail cream or Syn-ake cream w/ 3 drops Stratia Fortify oil --- Sunscreen.It works fairly quickly IMO, on my neck where I typically don't apply my Tret at night I noticed the peeling and balling of dead skin on day one and on my face where I have a patch of really awful CCs I noticed them getting smaller and smoother by around day 3-4. I'm going on about 8 days now and they're barely visible unless I'm right up in the mirror and feel as if they're almost gone when I touch my fingers to that area. I do have some slight peeling of the skin around my mouth and nose but it's not terrible (likely because I already exfoliate the heck out of my skin with the tret).Some tips and things keep in mind:1)DO NOT RINSE IT OFF. I don't understand some of the top reviews advising people to do that, it says on the bottle not to rinse and nearly all chemical exfoliators are meant to be left on until the next cleansing specifically so they can do their job. If you rinse it off you're either going to prevent it from properly exfoliating or end up irritating the hell out of your skin. If you have oily skin and feel this might be heavy on you than you can probably just use this on bare skin and  then sunscreen if you use in the AM or a lightweight lotion/cream and be done with it, but you need to leave it on your skin.2)You have got to use sunscreen while you're using this product! Any BHA or AHA exfoliant causes increased sun sensitivity and you have to address that in your routine. You should already use sunscreen daily but it becomes a must when you incorporate a chemical exfoliator or you risk sun damage.3)Less is more! Don't slop this on your face or soak a cotton pad in it, a little goes a long way and you'll be kicking yourself if you apply way too much and have to wait 20+ minutes for it to sink in. Use a shake or two and add more if needed but go easy.4)Expect some irritation initially. Chemical exfoliants can be harsh and rough even on sturdy skin and you have to give yourself time to adjust. Over-exfoliation is a possibility but sometimes just introducing a BHA or AHA into your routine can cause some sensitivity. Don't panic and just be gentle to your skin. Use ceramides (like Cerave Skin Renewing cream) or fatty oils to soothe your face if needed and try to stay away from any harsh products or acids like Vitamin C right after applying this to avoid really burning your face."
"The lady that does my hair told me about this product, she did me a great big favor. She told me to put it on my face after I wash it, applying it to where I have large pores, my nose. Within just days the poor started to shrink and now they look wonderful. I highly recommend this and I just bought a second bottle for the downstairs bathroom. I like to use exfoliating facial wipes in the morning to clean my face and then I apply this product with either my finger, q-tip or cotton rounds. So if you have large pores I would suggest you get a bottle of this, it will clean them out and shrink them."
"I’ve been using the Paula’s Choice SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant for a few weeks now, and wow—this stuff is legit! My skin has never looked this smooth. I struggle with blackheads, enlarged pores, and the occasional fine lines, but this exfoliant handles it all.After just a few uses, I noticed my pores looked smaller, and the stubborn blackheads on my nose started to clear up. My skin feels softer and more balanced—no more oily T-zone by midday. Plus, it’s gentle enough that I haven’t experienced any redness or irritation, which is a big win since I have somewhat sensitive skin.I apply it every other night after cleansing, and it absorbs quickly without feeling sticky. A little goes a long way, so the bottle will definitely last! If you’re on the fence, trust me—this product is worth every penny.Pro tip: Follow up with a good moisturizer and sunscreen during the day because this stuff really gets your skin working!"
"Been using this for a while and within days i felt like i was seeing results. It dried my skin after use but i applied face cream to help. I saw some very gentle peeling after some time so i knew it was working, my face just felt and looked more even toned, firm and clean"
"I’ve tried everything and nothing can match this.It’s a little oily like others have mentioned but I apply with a cotton round then I rub in with my hands.. this gets it deeper into the skin.  Does not burn and not a terrible smell.  Has reduced pores and reduced reddish tones on my cheeks.  I do not use daily but I do use it 3 times a week., at night.  I wouldn’t Recommend in the morning or using under makeup.  After I apply and rub it in I let it sit for about 30 min then I apply my good nighttime cream. Skip your serums when using this it will just cancele them out especially vit C.  Highly recommend to anyone wanting to shrink pores and even out skin tones/oils!  couldn’t live without it!"
This stuff has been a game changer for my skin. After I’d say 7-10 days my skin is totally glowing. It doesn’t burn or tingle but I’m used to acids on my face. It does have a slight odor but to be expected and doesn’t both me at all. I would recommend working up to daily because it can dry your skin out but it’s definitely a staple in my night time routine.
"I’m going to be honest with you I did not look at the size of the bottle before I bought it so when it came as a teeny tiny travel size for like the price of a full size I was a little taken aback but I used it anyway. I have no idea what it does. I can’t tell the difference. I was confused that it was a liquid exfoliate and that you didn’t need water to use it, but I’m not a skin care guru so I have no idea. I did get it in my mouth once and it was disgusting but I keep using it and it’s not doing anything bad so that’s a plus."
"I bought this and the BHA 9 spot treatment for sebaceous gland bumps on my face. I honestly can't tell if it works. I've been using it for over a year. They aren't getting bigger, but not shrinking. I keep using it since I don't know if this is helping slow down the bumps from getting bigger. I would not waste the money if you're looking for help with blackheads or milias. If it wasn't for the sebaceous glands and hoping it's preventing them from getting larger, I wouldn't waste the money."
"La cantidad es bastante, hace meses que lo pedí y aun tengo la mitad aprox. Lo uso en rostro de 1 a 2 veces por semana. También lo aplique en codos y manos para suavizar y funciono de maravilla. Si se nota el cambio en la piel, no irrita, la calidad vale la pena el precio mil veces. Aplico pomada aquaphor como mascarilla después del exfoliante y mi piel amanece divina"
This leaves my skin feeling very clean & soft without drying it out.
"Muy bueno he notado cambios en piel, incluso han disminuido los puntos negros en mi nariz."

"This is my first ever chemical exfoliant. I've used a BHA product in the past, but I didn't find it did anything substantial to my skin and thus, never really thought to go back to it. However, this product came highly recommended and I decided to give it a shot.Note about my skin: I tend toward dry skin that can be pimple-prone in the chin (and more recently neck!) area. I have enlarged pores on my nose and occasionally on my cheeks. My skin is also uneven and I have brown spots from prior cystic acne. I picked up this product to, thus, help with the occasional pimple, enlarged pores, and unevenness in skin tone. My husband also shares this product with me, though he has oily skin and his problem is enlarged pores around the nose and cheeks with the occasional pimple in these areas.Because my skin is on the drier side and I use a physical exfoliant around three times a week, I use this product max twice a week on the days I would use a hydrating cleanser. Application is about a nickel-sized amount on my fingers that I then rub in. I've used it for about two months at this point.I will say this product, even with minimal use, helped with my skin texture. Before my skin tended to feel very dull and I've noticed a difference. My brown spots have not changed since using, but I also didn't expect any change since I use the product so infrequently and haven't used it for long.Prior to using this BHA formulation, my pimples were frequent - probably having a new one once the last one healed. Initial use didn't eradicate the pimples, but it sped up the healing process substantially. I don't think I've had a new pimple now for the past month.My skin is generally fine after using, though it will feel dry if I don't put on a moisturising cream right away (I tend to wait 30 minutes after application to be sure the BHAs have time to do their thing). However, this isn't out of the ordinary for me in general even when I gently cleanse.I can't say I've noticed a difference in pore size, but I'm willing to keep using it given the other pros. I'd also like to see if this will become more noticeable with prolonged use.As for my husband, who uses it as frequently as I do, it has helped with skin tone as well as keeping pimples at bay. Once again, no big difference in pore size.Overall, definitely a great BHA product if you're in the market for one (and have the funds to buy it). If you have the occasional pimple that seems to take forever to heal and your skin feels very dull in general, I'd definitely say try this product out. If you have dry skin, it would be a good idea to build up usage in case it really irritates your skin. If you're only looking to use it for enlarged pores, I personally have not noticed a difference, but I also only use it once a week and I've only used it for two months. Take that as you will."
"Talk about deep hydration, this really does the trick. Leaves my skin hydrated and with a smooth texture all day long. I do recommend, if you have a not so dry skin, go with the light version. I didn’t see that option when I made the purchase and I think that one would have been better for my skin. What I have been doing is applying a small quantity of the product because otherwise my skin would be excessively moist, almost greasy."
"This is quite possibly the BEST toner I have come across, especially for my skin type (combination) I like to put toner on after I've worn makeup, to give my skin more moisture and let me just tell you, my skin went from dry and cracked to moisturized and soft. I have NEVER bought a toner that worked as well as this one has!! It also s.ells quite nice and has a nice watery texture, a little also goes a long way, I would say it was money well spent!!"
Just bought this last night and tried it this morning and my skin has never looked SO HYDRATED and felt so soft. It gives your skin a glow without being oily or sticky. It sinks in very nicely. Just off first impression now that I’ve had this on my skin since 6am now it’s 10:17am.. I will definitely repurchase this. Didn’t feel the need to put moisturizer on but still did and I’m very impressed bc my skin is very dry and it’s feeling great.
"I was struggling with product breakouts and I wasn’t sure why! I had been using different new products and I had never before struggled with breakouts! I was hesitant to use this because I wasn’t sure if it would make my breakout worse. I even bought the smallest size just incase, BUT I am sooooo happy I took a leap of faith and started using this product! It did not cause any product breakout! In fact it has helped my skin feel and look sooo hydrated! I absolutely love this product! I will be repurchasing but this time the bigger bottle!"
I wanted to give this one a try since I originally tried the original version in a smaller ounce and I loved how that left. My skin decided to try this one just because I want to see the difference was not so impressed but this might be suitable for people with Skin that is more sensitive. Still approve it.
I noticed changes in my skin in 2 weeks after using this product. I have been struggling a lot with texture and closed comedones on my forehead along with hyperpigmentation from old breakouts for months. My forehead is so smooth now and my dark spots have faded so much so quickly. My pores are also smaller and my skin is so smooth overall since if started using this toner. I feel that it has prevented new breakouts from forming as well since I haven’t had any breakouts while using it . I definitely recommend this toner and will be repurchasing!
"I've only been using this toner for a few weeks but it's already become a favorite! I love the milky texture, and can feel the hydration as soon as I pat it into my skin! And the glass bottle is lovely which makes it nice to display on my bathroom shelf! I've already ordered a travel size too!"
"Really wanted to like this toner. I'm so glad I got the mini size of this. Very moisturizing and love the consistency. Worked so well with my moisturizer. Did not even need to use a serum in between steps. Unfortunately, after 3 days of use, I noticed small little bumps forming around my cheeks and side of my face. After I stopped using it, it all went away after a night. If you have sensitive skin like me, beware."
It works well! It helps with my oily skin. Just get the light one if you have oily skin.
"Desde el empaque hasta el producto se siente de muy buena calidad, recomendado"
"I’ll start my review off by saying that I have dry skin (occasional eczema patches, peeling, pain, you name it) and I live in a VERY dry and cold climate, I’m talking -40 degrees Celsius and dry cold winds. I needed something that got my face moisturized to my liking and didn’t burn (dry skin girlies know what that feels like), and gave me a finish that I liked, this being not oily but more “glassy”. I decided to give this toner a try and it’s the best toner I’ve ever used and it honestly looks great. It’s really hydrating and my skin absorbs it pretty quickly, the hydration lasts for a long time, and it’s not a “oily” kind of hydration whereas the product just looks and feels like grease. It makes my skin glow, plump, and soft. It actually hydrated my skin so much that I could double down on my moisturizer? Didn’t notice any sort of scent or unusual texture. This product ended up working for me and gave me the results I wanted💗"
It’s just moisturizing but not worth the money. I mean any normal cream brand would do that for cheaper price.

I used to think all glycolic acids were the same as one as they had the same active ingredient.  I’ve tried about 10 different glycolic acids over the past few years and recently came back to this one. This by far is the BEST glycolic acid toner I’ve tried! It works INSTANTLY! Brightened your face and reduces hyperpigmentation. Great value for the price point!
"I have an oily t-zone, combination skin, and was searching for a toner that would help my scars, blackheads, as well as getting my skin extra clean. I don't break out too much on my forehead, mostly my chin, and more recently it's been my nose.I stumbled along Mario Badescu, and could not be happier with this toner. I've gone through one full bottle of the 8oz, and I purchased it in November of 2011, and now it's the middle of December, 2012. I'd say that's good longevity for everyday, morning and night use.However, one -important- hint: Do not use a cotton ball to put the product on and then wipe your face, nix the cotton ball altogether and put a small dot of the liquid on your fingers- it's tricky to get it the first time to only come out a bead at a time, but just lean the 'squirter' on to your fingers and tip just a little ways. (It's water consistency, and will not be blue on your face.) Then take your *clean* hands and wipe your face with it. I guarantee you, this works, and I wished I had done it this way since I got the product; I used up almost half the bottle in probably only two months using the cotton ball method in the beginning.I use the Glycolic Acid Toner by washing my face night/day (I use a sulfur soap) and then pat dry. With my clean hands, I gently wipe the toner pretty much everywhere, adding more to my fingers and wiping down any areas I feel need it. Let dry.My face turns red using this, but that's just simple blood circulation and the 'harshness' of pushing/rubbing on my skin.(I'm beginning to diagnose myself as sensitive.) I also used to only use it in the night, but after I felt like my skin kinda needed it in the morning.I've noticed my skin ""craving"" this more in the winter- I feel like it's a good way to exfoliate the dead winter dryness. However, it SAVED my skin when I went from the Utah climate to Houston in the summer- I was breaking out, and couldn't leave little zits everywhere, so after I popped them, I used this- it dries it up, and burns anything that's open a little, but it helps with scars and probably disinfects some. I wouldn't say that it helps greatly with blackheads, but I'm guessing if you have 'first stage' blackheads it'll probably help: mine are about at the stage 'embedded in my skin for eternity.' :D I do think it helps with scars, it just takes time. It speeds the regular process up, I'd say, though.The first time you use this, you'll probably notice tingling, but after regular use this goes away. This gives my skin a great glow, and it does not break me out, (oily, combo, redness, zits on chin and nose, blackheads on nose.) Does not dry out my skin, even in the winter. I'm 16, for more info.I purchased just recently the 16 oz size, and I've noticed in a year: The ingredients are the same, but it seems like this 'fresher batch' made more immediate improvement- maybe it would be a better idea to by the smaller size? Like the ingredients become expired? (No expiration date that I've found.) And also, the only thing on the label that's changed is it says not to use on breakout-erupted skin. I wouldn't say my acne is severe, more slightly moderate. I have no problem with this toner. I love it!Bottom line: Buy if you want fresh, clean skin, to reduce acne scarring, help early blackheads, with a nice clean glow and mild exfoliation."
I love this toner! It really brightens and hydrates my face! I use a cotton pad and saturate the pad and wipe all over my face including my neck! I've noticed my face looking less dull and brighter! I'm oily combo skin but I do get dryness in my t zone. It's a must have toner and it doesn't have a strong scent either.
"I like the scent of this and the way it makes my skin feel.  It is a bit drying but to help with this I have gone down to using 3 times per week.,"
"I have extremely sensitive skin and  have had an allergic reaction to something off and on for the last year.  We've narrowed down to what the possible allergic  reactions could be but my skin can  become very irritated very easily.  It got to the point that I  only washed my face with plain water daily or with Noxzema once or twice a week.  So, I need to be very careful what I use on my face.The problem with some skin care products is that they remove the oils from your skin and then your skin is too dry.  The skin then tries to compensate and becomes  too oily.  For me, this product does not do that.I bought this toner, even though I thought it a bit pricey at the start, because of the glycolic acid in it.  This is supposed to help remove dead skin cells and stimulate collagen growth.  I did look that up on Google before buying.  I was expecting it to redden my skin like some men’s skin care products but it doesn't on my skin.  Now, after using it for a few weeks, it’s worth every penny.I use it of a morning and of an evening before going to bed.  I may rinse my face with water first, apply this, let sit and then apply it a second time.  I also took a chance on buying Kiehl's moisturizer which I then usually apply a very small amount after I shower or sometimes not.Because of the allergy issue and a precancerous keratoma spot or two I had,  I see a dermatologist every six months.  Basically my doctor visits are now a follow up for these conditions. The doctor looked at my face this last time and said my skin looked very good.  That’s a pretty good recommendation coming from a dermatologist.The bottle has a flip up little spout meaning you can more accurately dispense the amount you want. And, if you should happen to drop it, the amount spilled will be a lot less because of this type of cap.I started using the Kiehl's first and then this a few weeks later.  My skin looks very good compared to how it did only a few months ago since beginning this regimen."
I use this every night and I have noticed my skin looks better! I have really oily skin and it works really well for me.
I have been using a clinique toner forever. Tried this and saw it works so much better! I still can't believe how much dirt and impurity it pulled from my skin and was way more gentle.
"I have launched a comprehensive, full-throttle attack recently on my skin. It's always been pretty good, but age, health and stress have dulled it and lines are peeking through. Hence the glycolic acid toner.I use it twice daily with a cotton pad, making sure to use it as an application not a cleaning solution. Because I am at war I have been applying it under my eyes and it does sting for a few minutes (then dissapates). That is my fault, not theirs.My skin is smoother and definitely more hydrated. I have been using a variety of new products, so I cannot say for sure that it's helped in toning my skin, but it hasn't done anything negative either. It used to pull and tighten horribly and now looks healthy and tone is improving.Will repurchase!"
"Me ha ayudado mucho a disminuir las manchar. Huele delicioso. Las primeras veces me dio un poco de comezón, pero leí que era normal. Lo uso tres veces por semana y mi piel se ve mucho más luminosa y con menos pecas."
"Une lotion tonique efficace pour clarifier le teint.L'application est agréable, le produit ne colle pas.Dommage que le prix ait augmenté."
Puede escocer algo sobretodo si lo acercas a la zona de los ojos pero deja la piel limpia y lista para el resto de productos de la rutina facial.
it's give instant brightness to my skin and after applying this am getting very soft and flawless skin.
I have used this product for many years. After cleansing it takes the leftover makeup off. My skin is normal to oily.
I always buy this works great
"price , quality and name brand"
Perfect for my oily skin
I purchased this thinking it was just a face toner but it’s witch hazel.  I was pleasantly surprised and it’s light weight and a little goes a long way
"I have had trouble finding this in stores for a while. So glad to find on Amazon. I got two for about what I was paying for one before. Amazed at how cheap this is considering what a great product it is. Works as well as the clinique I have been using, but only a fraction of the cost. Refreshes your skin while removing the oils and makeup that the facial washes leave behind. The entire olay line is quality with affordability."
I have been using this Product since I was a teenager ! I like it very Much ! However it very hard to find it ! I truly happy in able to get it firm ! Amazon ! Thank You
A great value for the price & quantity
"Somehow I've lived 50 years without using toner. So at this point, I thought I was too old. I was so wrong! ...and I don't know how I lived so long without it!!!!!!? It is wonderful. It makes my skin feel so clean and refreshed. My pores are reducing in size. I love the scent. It's the greatest product ever!"
Great product for an every day routine for oily skin: removes the grease well without drying the skin. Smells very fresh!
"This was recommended to me by someone in the ""Beauty Industry"" to be used as a splash after shaving.  Works great!!"
"Great toner, my face feels so fresh after using it. And you can't go wrong with a 2 pack at this price."
Great price and arrived before expected arrival date. Doesn't dry out my skin and has helped to minimize breakouts
This is an amazing product. Really does shrink pores. Clean feeling after use. Only complaint is it’s a bit expensive but does go a long way.
Too expensive for me.  Looking for something more affordable.  It doesn’t really shrink my pores.
i’m a black man who has constantly had issues with open pores and razor bumps. this is only thing that has consistently worked for me in the 20 years i’ve been shaving and having these issues. paired with the moisturizer and sunscreen i legitimately look 10 years younger
This is a product you have to use for a while to see if it will help or not.  Not an instant deal.
I absolutely love this toner.  It is wonderful for my pores and is not drying to the skin.
Finished using the entire bottle and honestly did not really see a difference.For the price I expect to see some improvement but did not see any here. Would not repurchase
"PICK YOUR PRIORITY!  Do you want Much better looking skin—quite rapidly, I might add, LIKE IN TWO WEEKS—OR, whine about the scent (it’s not perfume, but certainly tolerable) & the cost (Get real people-quality products co$t--otherwise, just dump some rubbing alcohol & petroleum jelly on your face.) I rarely ever write a review unless the item is exceptionally better than expected-as in this case- - Or, a really bad product. When I am on the fence about purchasing a new product-I DO read reviews.The constant theme by high cost complainers gets old!!Either people aren’t exposed to what decentskincare products sell for, or only shop at a budget store. You DO get when you pay for—not to sound trite, but it is VERY TRUE in this case. (This is actually one of the lower priced skincare lines.) I am stunned at how fantastic it works!!  It does remove  those blackheads and tightens the skin, while adding a healthy glow-and in two weeks for me. This product was so successful that I also purchased Dr Pericone’s bronzer, highlighter and blush—ALL WINNERS, but too lazy to write more reviews-at least for now! 5*****STARS!!!"
I have been using this daily for a couple of weeks and I have not noticed any breakouts on my face even during that time of the month! I think the salicylic acid is really helping my face not breakout! Highly recommend!!
Je l utilisé pour les pores dilatées et à date c est un des meilleurs produits que j ai essayé !!
"Tengo la piel grasosa, desde la primera aplicación noté el cambio. Desilusionada de diversas aguas micelares que son más bien para pieles secas o normales decidí comprarlo al ver este producto en una revista española. Mis poros después de 30 días se ven menos aunque debo decirlo no habrá nada que los tape por completo pero al menos al controlar la grasa evito futuros poros abiertos lo recomiendo al mil."
"Ich kenne das Produkt schon viele Jahre. Das Design und auch der Inhalt haben sich leider verändert. Ich muss allerdings sagen zum negativen. Das Produkt hat nicht mehr viel mit ihm zu tun was ist einmal war. Das einzige was geblieben ist ist der Geruch. Der Inhalt hat sich extrem verändert. Früher war dieser erweislich von der flüssigen Formel und der Konsistenz her, heute sieht es aus wie durchsichtiges klares Wasser. Vorher waren auch so leichte weiße Flocken enthalten, die sich auf der Haut aufgelöst beziehungsweise mit der Haut verbunden haben. Dadurch hat man wirklich eine porenlose extrem weiche Haut erhalten. Von Porenverkleinerung merke ich heute allerdings bei diesem neuen veränderten Produkt nichts mehr. Es hat mit dem alten paar Minimizer nichts mehr zu tun. Schade heute hat man er das Gefühl dass man ein ganz normales Gesichtswasser in der Hand hat. Daher werde ich es nicht mehr kaufen"
"Conoscevo gia' il prodotto, ma il costo su Amazon e' convenientissimo rispetto al sito di Perricone. Lo uso principalmente come tonico, ma in emergenza anche come detergente viso. E' riconoscibile dopo il primo impatto, quel vago odore di pesce tipico della linea ""Cold Plasma""."
The bottle arrived broken and made a mess all over my floor
Love this product. Price is right; product is effective and a little goes a long way.
"Perfect toner, the smell was Livy and left skin soft"
Works well for sensitive skin. Use as described and it works to clean and add hydration. A nice rose smell too. Would recommend.
"I absolutely love this stuff, makes my skin so soft. I only have it 3 stars because it came with no top so quite a bit spilled out in the box.Update: I changed my stars to 5 because customer service is outstanding!!!"
"Has a very light rose scent. It does the job good enough it even takes off leftover make up even after washing your face, it removes the rest of it."
"I have read many negative comments, so I decided to write one. I have not had an allergic reaction and I have sensitive skin, as well as being allergic to legumes and allergies in my nose. It smells totally like roses to me, nothing chemical in my opinion."
My dry skin soaks this stuff up. I use it right out of the shower and between each skincare step. Seller wrapped and handled with care wich I was so pleased about so no leaks. Definitely gonna repurchase
This is the BEST brand of rose water toner out there!
"This is my absolute favourite toner. It smells so good leaves your skin feeling really really soft and there’s a really good base for the beginning of your skincare routine. Literally my only complaint is that it’s not widely sold in the UK which is why I think it’s so expensive. I do think that it is on the pricey side, but I love the product that much that I will pay for it."
"Product came sealed extremely well, so no leaking occurred during shipping and I appreciate that. Took a little while but I received exactly what I asked for. As for the product itself, i’ve been using it to tone ever since I got it. It’s definitely a game changer, and i’ve seen a major difference in my skin’s appearance; it looks visibly more plump and hydrated. Would recommend."
I'm so happy with it
"This rosewater toner is great for my face and feels so refreshing.  This is my ""go to"" for toners.  It really makes a difference when added with my moisturizing cream."
Happy with this product but not for use to remove eye make up just as a toner
"I fell in love with the COSRx Propolis Serum a while back.  (I wrote a really detailed review on that product that explains why.  Basically, it really helped heal my face & restored a ton of self-confidence.  It continues to keep working its ""magic"" or just keeping my skin in check at times.)  So, I finally decided to give this matching toner a try.  I think it's going to be another staple in my personal skincare routine.  I find it helps balance my skin better than using the serum alone.  It seems to help me absorb the serum better, too.  I've tried two other toners from the drugstore, but this one actually seems to be doing something effective for me.  I can actually feel and see results with this toner.I've been applying this immediately after cleansing and drying my face.  The different facial cleansers I sometimes switch between don't seem relevant to how this product performs.  All are gentle cleansers, but two are slightly more drying than the other one.  I'm still figuring out which one I like best.  Regardless, this toner seems to work the same no matter which of the cleansers I've used beforehand.I just swipe this toner over my face; and it feels like my skin is extra clean, balanced, and less dried out in some spots than if I went without it.  It seems to provide a clean, even canvas so I can better absorb the matching serum.That last part is pretty important to me considering I use the serum twice a day, every day.  The cost of routine products really adds up.  So, it's nice that I can use way less of the serum and have a slightly better effect when pairing it with this toner.  I feel like it's worth the money because it'll reduce how quickly I'll use up a bottle of the serum.  (I seem to have started using a little less than half the amount of serum when I apply this toner first.  It took a while before I noticed I didn't need as much of the serum anymore.)  I don't know for sure if I'll actually be saving money or just adding a tiny bit more to my expenses by adding this product to my daily routine.  But even if I'm spending a little more, the effects this has on my skin is worth it to me.I would recommend this toner to others.  Particularly to those who suffer from skin problems, like: inflammation, severe dryness that causes irritation or damage, occassional acne, folliculitis, and post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation (like skin darkening/redness from acne or scars).JUST TO BE CLEAR:  I am not claiming this product will cure all those problems I just mentioned.  Those are just some major issues that I've dealt with or still deal with to various extents.Personal experience:  I used to have practically ""perfect-looking"" skin that hardly required any special upkeep for most of my life.  Several years ago, when I was in my 30s, I got hit with some major skin problems/damages.  It took a very long time and a lot of effort to get most of those problems under control.  Ultimately, I was left with a lot of scarring and hyper-pigmentation on my face that really frustrated me and made me self-conscious.  I wasn't used to feeling so insecure about my face.  I wasn't used to skincare products either.  But I had to learn and adjust accordingly.  Over the last year or so, I've been gradually figuring out a skincare routine that really works for me and that has been drastically improving my skin appearance (as well as overall condition).  This toner just seems like something that's significantly helping me deal with or recover from those skin issues I mentioned right now.  I wanted to write this review in case anyone else out there can relate and is still trying to figure out their own personal skincare routine.  Hopefully, the info I provided will be helpful.  I'd say definitely give this a shot if you find the COSRx propolis serum has been helpful for you.  Give it about a week and see if your skin starts absorbing the serum better.  (I'm still figuring out the whole moisturizer ordeal.  Unfortunately, the whole COSRx Propolis line up doesn't work for me.  Just this and the other product.)UPDATE MANY MONTHS LATER: Confirmed.  This toner has become a part of my daily routine.  But I also found another use for it!  Whenever my propolis serum ""runs out,"" there always seems to be a small amount left in the bottom crevices of the bottle that I just can't reach.  (The serum comes in a glass bottle with a dropper lid.)  I hate wasting products - especially ones that are on the pricier side.  I had 2 bottled of the ""left over"" serum on hand.  I squeezed a tiny bit of this toner into the ""empty"" serum bottles & shook them up.  Voila!  A perfect match!  I was able to get the last bit of the serum by using the dropper or by tapping the bottle into my hand.  Combining the 2 doesn't have quite the same effect as using them 1 after the other.  But they still work very well together.  I was able to use up all of the remaining serum.  And this mixture was especially convenient on days when I was in a hurry, but didn't want to skimp out on my skincare routine & risk old problems popping up.  I've decided this toner is a win in the skincare, money-saving, & convenience departments.  So glad I gave this a shot.  (Just wanted to share this ""new hack"" for any of you struggling with skin issues & trying to manage your routine on a dime!  Good luck!)"
"I have red, sensitive skin from a damaged skin barrier. I am obsessed with this toner!!! It’s so light and hydrating. I can use multiple layers in substitution for a moisturizer even with my dehydrated skin and living in an area with extreme hard water. It makes my skin so plump! I’ve tried other toners and nothing compares!"
"It’s really gentle and gives you that glow before adding the rest of your routine, I’ve repurchased twice so far!"
"As someone with sensitive skin, the cosrx propolis toner is pretty gentle and doesn't appear to give me allergic reactions. However, after applying it, my skin feels a bit tight and dry, so I haven't used it much."
"This is my favorite brand, and this toner makes me glow!"
"While I didn’t like the other products by this company, I do love this product. Just a bit on my hands and it rubs nicely into skin, even letting me skip moisture cream when in a rush. Fairly thin but not slimy. I do think it’s helping my skin and I love how it feels and how easy it is to apply. Recommend it!"
""
It's hydrating and makes my skin feel soft. I really enjoy using it.
good product
Suits my skin so well.  10/10 product
Wirklich ganz tolles Produkt.  Es spendet sehr viel Feuchtigkeit und ist sehr angenehm unter der Creme. Ich benutze es morgens und abends und bin sehr zufrieden.  Meine Mischhaut verträgt das Produkt sehr gut.

I've been using the Propolis Synergy Toner for a little while now, and as someone who’s been into Korean skincare, I can say this toner definitely has its perks. 🐝✨First off, the texture is lovely—light and easy to apply, and it sinks right in without leaving any sticky residue. It’s been great for keeping my skin hydrated and calm, especially when I’m dealing with redness or irritation. That soothing effect is a big win for me.Now, I know a lot of people rave about this toner giving them a glowing complexion, but honestly, I haven’t noticed any dramatic glow on my skin. That said, it still works well to keep things balanced and hydrated, which is really all I need in a toner.My friend kindly lent me hers while we were in Greece. I was ready for some breakouts after being under the 40-degree sun all day and swimming in salty water, but I didn’t get any irritation, let alone breakouts. That’s why I decided to give it another try back in the UK.So, while it might not be a game-changer in the glow department for me, it’s definitely earned a spot in my skincare routine for its calming and hydrating benefits. If you're looking for something that keeps your skin happy without any fuss, this one is worth a try. 🐝💛"
👍
"This is one of my favorite toners I have ever used. and I have tried many over the years. so when this was marked down to $5.99+another 30% off at checkout, yeah I got a few more bottles even though I already had a full one in my bathroom. it's just super gentle, which is great for me as I have very sensitive skin. it doesn't have an overbearingly strong smell, but a light pleasant scent that is barely noticeable, which is also good for me. the packaging is great, I love the lids. and it lasts a while. while I haven't noticed a reduction in pore size, I have noticed my skin looks brighter. and if my face is particularly dirty, like as in been in the garden all day with dirt and all manner of outside nonsense blowing in my face, it will sometimes push the gunk out of my pores so it's easier to wipe up of take an extractor tool to."
I love everything about this product. Leaves my face feeling clean and glowing.
Doesn't strip your skin...doesn't irritate the skin and I use it with the youth boosting cream for day and the midnight miracle night time cream. I've used several eclat products and like the line for cost and effect of products. No huge changes but it is nice product.
I love the product. Definitely worth getting. Unsure on re-buying this product so its just a maybe for now. but definitely worth it.
"I have been using this for 3 weeks now. No Acne, No Burning and feels good on face. I noticed brown spots fading away too! My pores are shrinking too. So will continue to use. I Highly recommend this product for anyone wanting to shrink pores, diminish brown spots and get fresh and hydrated feeling on face."
"The toner doesn't have the best scent to it, but I was able to deal with it. What I wasn't crazy about was the instant redness and irritation the can after using it on my face. My face was red for a few days after using it and I had to be super careful with moisturizers, as a result. My facial skin has always been a bit sensitive, and definitely more sensitive than the rest of mu body, but all is not lost. I think this could be useful as a foot cleanser or as a toner for my shoulders and back, where it won't matter as much if it dries my skin."
"Not sure how I stumbled across this product but it’s definitely a good one. I primarily use it after shaving(Man) followed by a moisturizer and it does a good job of soothing any irritation. Instead of alcohol or witch hazel it uses cactus juice/water as the main toning aspect. It also has some extra skin food in there: hyaluronic acid, aloe, niacinimide, and glycerin to name a few. It also contains salicylic acid as an exfoliant which I would expect to burn bad after shaving but it does not. If I have a spot that I went over too many times with the razor and is extra sensitive I may get a slight sting but it’s only momentary and nothing like you would get from an alcohol based product. A very nice and soothing toner with extra good stuff for your skin all for $10 is a good deal in my opinion. Only bad thing being that it’s made in China? Wasn’t expecting that since the brand Eclat touts itself as a natural skin care company and China is the last place I would have expected their products to be made in(maybe I’m just nieve lol). Anyways a great product that I highly recommend and if for some reason you don’t like it then I’m sure you can easily find someone to pass it on to as this product will work for the majority of people(sensitive skin too) and you won’t be out a lot of money like some of these other ridiculously high priced toners on here that don’t have half the good ingredients that this one does……….Good Stuff"
This is by far the best toner I've used so far. Love the fact it has simple yet effective ingredients it makes my face feel so fresh and doesn't dry my face.
Muy refrescante y efectivo. Huele bien. Repetiré
This toner made my face feel fresh and clean so therefore I really like it moreso than the rose ones I've used before
"Délicieux ! Léger, agréable, pas agressant pour la peau. C'est un plaisir. Du coup je l'utilise matin et soir. (J'aime tout qu'est cactus et/ou aloe vera.) 💚PS. Le prix en Oct a diminué, mais la livraison coût maintenant 4.99 € !!!"
"Echt genial ! Etwas teurer , als die vergleichbaren Produkte , aber die Haut ist dankbar - keine Rötungen / Allergien / Probleme. Man meint ... es ist nur Wasser ,,, aber die Haut ist herrlich weich und beruhigt Für die Abendpflege absolut perfekt."
"Un tónico estupendo para combinar con el agua de rosas también de esta marca. FANTASTICO , este producto y todos los demás."
Love the consistency of the product and how it absorbs quickly into my skin .
I use about 8 toners and this one is my favorite!
Works perfectly… very hydrating 😍😍does it work
My skin has never felt so good.  Run don't walk get this before the secret is out and it's out of stock.
"The most noticeable change I’ve noticed since using this product is my skin is much softer smoother and even toned. Highly recommended, no perfume, very light smell of licorice."
"Had a hard time finding I toner I loved, but this is one of them! I love how it makes my face look!!"
Came fast
"This toner is a staple in my routine. Hydrating, calming, and great for evening complexion."
"Saw this all over TikTok, I have sensitive skin so I’ve been using Acwell and I’m From Rice Toner as well and it’s a perfect combo! Feels and smells amazing"
I have been using it for the past 3years now
"Very good toner, it gets the job done. I just keep repurchasing."
Tonico antibatterico..buona per la piele problematica
"Bought as a gift; not sure how to objectively review this type of product, but was told it was surprisingly and quickly effective, so... 5 stars."
"I tried several toners before, and this toner is the one I enjoy the most. It does not leave my face feeling tacky or slimy. It is very soothing and moisturizing."
This toner is my favorite toner of all time it’s so smooth when applied. It’s very moisturizing and great for sensitive skin. Would highly recommend
This product hydrate and glow my face ..I will keep buying..
I like the feeling of this and it seems hydrating enough. I found it to be overhyped but it will still get the job done in terms of hydrating your skin.
"I’ve been using this toner for a couple of months now, and I’m liking it. I bought it based on get ingredients, and liking it so far."
"I have mature skin and have fine lines with a few dark spots from sun damage, as well as some areas with larger pores. I hate wearing make-up so I usually just tone and mositurize. I have tried so many toners, at all price points, however this toner is hands down the best I have tried and very affordable.  It does a wonderful job at shrinking my pores and moisturing my skin as well as fading my dark spots and plumping my fine line areas.  It does not dry my skin or make it feel tight. It makes my skin feel wondeful. I don't feel I need mositurizer, but I like the SPF my mositurizer provides. I use it twice a day and only a little after a week, I am noticing a difference.  I am so happy that I tried this, I have already ordered more for my vacation home."
Love how it leaves my face
"If you’re looking for toner that actually works, this is for you! The softness of my skin, super clean feeling after I cleanse, and the glow! You can’t beat the price and I will be purchasing again!"
"Je viens juste de l'acheter mais j'aime beaucoup ce produit. Aqueux mais pas trop liquide ce que je trouve pratique), mais pas du tout d'effet visqueux.Hydrate bien, pas collant. J'ai hâte de voir son effet sur le long terme.Pour l'instant très agréable, je n'ai pas eu de réaction irritante ni rien même si j'ai pris avec parfum lavende."
"Aun que tengo la piel sencible no me irritó, deja la piel muy sueve y hace que se vea sana. Creo que cumple con lo que dice. Obviamente creo que me va a durar algunos meses rinde mucho"
Súper efectivo
"Una coccola…consistenza semi densa…un odore delicato gradevolissimo…e pelle migliorata sin da subito…luminosa, uniforme, schiarita…"
"Me gusta mucho . Llevo una semana utilizándolo y no me ha provocado ninguna reacción en la piel. Tengo la piel grasa y es habitual que me salgan granitos con cremas y tónicos pero con este las sensaciones son muy buenas . Deja la piel luminosa e hidratada , es ligero y tiene aroma suave."
"I've been using the product for over a month,  twice a day! I'm always very thorough with my skincare since I suffer with rosacea and sensitive skin, so I'm leaving a VERY detailed review for those who want an in-depth look!I first saw this product while looking for essence on Amazon. After doing research and seeing my favorite dermatologist (Cassandra Bankson) suggest it for rosacea sufferers, I had to try it!!!!NOTE!!!:During this, I was also trying out these products at the same time which may have boosted results (I will be reviewing as well):-Paula's Choice Hydrating Gel to Cream Cleanser-Doppeltree RENEW Overnight Facial Mask with Aloe Vera Gel & Hyaluronic Acid----------------------------Performance- 10/10-This product is incredibly gentle on the skin! For those who suffer with rosacea or sensitive skin but wish to still use a toner, then this is the product for you! Make sure your skin is moist before applying to get the best results!-My favorite part about this product is that there is no fragrance or alcohol added. Fragrance in general is bad for any skin type. Sure it smells nice, but can be an irritant that leads to hives, redness, and itchy skin. Alcohol (not to be confused with Fatty Alcohols) in products can dry out skin, disrupt the skin barrier, and strains the skin, making it weak. Alcohol is often used for product to dry faster and degrease the skin. So if you have dry or sensitive skin, this product is safe! ALSO: If you happen to have Malassezia (fungal acne) this product is also safe to use!-Note: Toners all together should be avoided by rosacea sufferers and those with sensitive or dry skin, so always go for essence instead! Toners focus more on PH balance and often contain alcohol which is harmful to those with rosacea and sensitive skin. Essence is more for hydration. And when your skin is hydrated, it is able to absorb products better!----------------------------Consistency/Quality- 10/10-It feels very smooth, almost like a serum, and glides along the skin seamlessly. It dries fairly quick as well and works best when the skin is moist (like with any skincare product). The product never separates, but I always tend to shake it before each use just in case!----------------------------Ingredients- 9/10-What I love a lot about this product is that there are only 7 ingredients! With any good skincare product, always use the K.I.S.S system: Keep It Simple Stupid! The less ingredients, the more like it is to be better for you! I also love that this product has Astragalus and Arginine. Just sad that Arginine isn't higher up on the ingredient list (meaning there is less of it in the product).-There are quite a few ingredients that don't hurt but don't really help with the skin, though they MAY have SOME properties. BUT- all of the ingredients listed are safe for sensitive and rosacea prone skin! A lot of hydrating properties, so if you have dryer skin, a bonus! Like I mentioned before, there is no alcohol and no fragrances!-Note: All my research for each ingredient is done through using ""Paula's Choice Ingredient Dictionary"", ""INCIDecoder"", and ""SpecialChem"". I highly recommend using these websites to do deeper dives on ingredients in your skincare! I also used ""National Institutes of Health (NIH)"" for one of these ingredients.~Ingredient Overview~-Astragalus Membranaceus Root Extract (Astragalus/Milk-vetch root extract, herb)- Antioxidant, emollient, skin conditioning, anti-inflammatory, contains antiviral properties.-1,2-Hexanediol (a chemical relative to propylene glycol)-Synthetic preservative, solvent, moisture binding agent. But, is hydrating!-Butylene Glycol (1,3-Butanediol, organic compound)-Texture enhancer, humectant, solvent, penetration booster. But, is hydrating and MAY also decrease roughness on the surface of skin.-Bis-PEG-18 Methyl Ether Dimethyl Silane (Silicon-based polymer/Silicone)-Skin conditioning agent, surfactant, foam booster, moisturizer.- Fun fact- Silicone is completely safe for your skin in cosmetics! (Source: Bains, Pooja, and Simplepreet Kaur. “Silicone in Dermatology: An Update.” Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery, U.S. National Library of Medicine, 28 Apr. 2023,)-Hydroxyethylcellulose (Chemical compound, naturally derived from cellulose)-Texture enhancer, film-forming agent, pH Adjuster/Stabilizer, natural thickener. Completely safe for skin.-Carbomer (Polyacrylic acid, a series of polymers that derive from acrylic acid)-Texture enhancer, pH adjuster/stabilizer, thickener. Can increase skin permeation and retention of key active ingredients. Completely safe for skin up to 15% concentrate.-Arginine (Amino Acid naturally present in the body)-Hydrating, anti-aging, antioxidant benefits, repairing for visible skin damage, key role in skin’s natural production of replenishing substances such as proline and urea.----------------------------Value For Money- 10/10-Perfect value for your money! Real bang for your buck! It's been a month and I still have plenty after using it twice a day everyday!----------------------------Overall- 10/10!!!-This is a great product! I enjoy it greatly and believe those who suffer with rosacea, dry skin, and/or sensitive will enjoy it too! No fragrance, no alcohol, just 7 ingredients, and as gentle as ever! Absolutely love this!"
"Mi piel es mixta con tendencia a acné, vivo en un clima cálido y tropilal, por lo tanto sudo mucho.Me encanta porque me deja la piel suave y con un pequeño glow, no importa cuantas capas aplique siempre se absorbe bien y no me deja grasosa y además me refresca.Cuando hace demasiado calor y sé que debo salir a realizar trámites y sudaré mucho solo aplico varias capas de esto y luego el protector solar, y mi piel se mantiene bien durante el día. También muchas veces en la noche cuando siento mi piel muy sobrecargada solo aplico varias capas de esto como hidratante y calmante, y mi piel amanece mejor. Lo uso para todo, le he encontrado distintos usos, y uno de esos es como primer.TIP: Después de mi rutina usual de skin care reaplico varias capas como paso final porque deja mi piel suave y luego me aplico el maquillaje, mi piel queda flawless, porque me ayuda a cerrar los poros y crear una capa lisa."
"I have rosacea and very sensitive skin so it is very hard for me to find a toner that won’t irritate my skin and locks in moisture but this does the trick! I ruined my skin barrier during the Covid skin-tok craze and ever since I have been VERY careful with what products I put on my skin. I saw this was a highly recommended k beauty toner and is known for being good for sensitive skin and thought I’d give it a try. Thank god I did! I really can tell the difference in my skin, even when I rub the excess product in my hands. The only down side is that it is very expensive. However, if you are using it as directed, it should last you a long time."
"I love the viscous texture of this toner! Usually I use this after I wax my face, by soaking it onto toner pads and leaving it on like a mask. I notice a significant difference in my skin’s redness, and overall recovery time, when I do and don’t use this toner afterwards. I also find it really hydrating, and it’s part of my recovery routine when my skin has visible dryness."
"This is a good toner. Its a thicker base so goes on smoothly, leaves your face feeling very hydrated. Doesn't leave behind any residue. I have pretty sensitive skin and have had no reactions at all. I've been using it as a second base toner since it thicker after I have cleaned my face and leaves a nice shine."
"For reference I have very oily skin (mostly tzone) but if I don't use hydrating products, my skin feels extremely tight and rough. I was on the hunt for a ""milky"" toner or essence to layer on top of my mediheal toner pads (which make my skin a bit dry). I was going to go with the made from rice toner but after doing some research, I saw that a lot of people said it either didn't do much for them or irritated their fungal acne.Then I came across this product which checked all the boxes; not overly heavy or sticky, compatible with oily skin, no fungal acne triggering ingredients and the price is a BARGAIN. I just tried it today so I can't speak on the long term results yet; but it made my face feeling amazing!! It's very similar in texture to the snail mucin; translucent but slightly thicker than water. It was not sticky and absorbed into my skin almost immediately. My moisturizer, primer and concealer layered beautifully on top and my skin didn't feel at all heavy, oily or sticky."
One of my fave toners. Super hydrating and definitely one that I will purchase again and again. I highly recommend this. It is thick and feels great when applying it.
Es genial para piel delicada.
Works for my sensitive skin.
"Très bonne lotion, on a tout de suite la sensation d'une peau hydratée. Je rachèterai ce produit, c'est sûr."
Best hydrating toner for all skin types non irritable and gentle to skin
"Den Toner  habe ganz oft von  vielen Beauty Bloggern empfohlen gehört. Es gibt  auf sehr gute Rezensionen zu diesem Produkt. Allmählich kam ich auch zu den Gedanken mir diesen Toner zu kaufen. Best  ellung und  Zustellung erfolgte reibungslos. Ich benutze den Toner jedes Mal wenn ich mir mein Gesicht wasche, das wasche manchmal ein paarmal am tag , also der Toner reicht dafür, dass ich meine haut mit Feuchtigkeit versorgt fühle. Mit dem Alter ist meine Haut mehr trocken geworden.Das ist ein sehr guter Toner, den ich mit Sicherheit nachkaufen werde  und gerne weiter empfehlen kann.Ein kleiner Update von 24.11.2023. Der Toner bleibt immer noch mein lieblings Toner, die erste Flasche ist immer noch nicht leer , ein sehr ergebiges Produkt. Da jetzt die zeit des Black Fridays das Produkt im Angebot ist, habe ich ihn nachgekauft.  Gerne kann ich mit reinem Gewissen das Produkt weiterempfehlen!Das Service von Amazon ist hervorragend. Ich bin sehr zufrieden ."
"elf is some of the best skin care I have found. There is no fragrance, it lasts, it does the job intended and the cost is awesome!"
This product I have been bragging about so much🫶🏽. I absolutely love it 💞! I just recently finished esthetician school and I refer so many people to this product because it is truly amazing!!!!! Yall are sleeping 😴 on elf holy hydration! If your not using this your crazy 🙌🏽 I swear 🤞🏽get this product and fall head over heels in love with your youthful / glowing face after your purchase!
I love adding this to my skin care routine. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized and looking fresh.
"I love this product. I have extremely sensitive skin and this is an amazing moisturizer too. Doesn't dry u out, doesn't leave u feeling greasy either."
Llevo mucho tiempo usándolo y estoy muy satisfecha con el producto.  Me deja el rostro con una sensación de frescura sin tirantes.  Lo recomiendo!!!
"I am 55 years old and I have been taking care of my skin religiously since I was a teenager. I have used ridiculously expensive products on and off depending on income. Elf is now my go-to for pretty much anything related to my skincare. This toner is refreshing, hydrating, soothing, and my favorite part, cheap! I keep waiting for them to raise the prices. I have purchased three bottles of this and I have no intention of stopping. I like to keep mine in the refrigerator during the summer months. Very refreshing after a hot shower. Lastly, I don't have sensitive skin but I think this toner could be used across the board from oily to sensitive and dry"
I have sensitive/oily skin.  This Toner does not irritate my skin and leaves it feeling clean and refreshed.  The scent is very pleasant as well.  I use this after washing my face at night and it gets what the cleanser didn't.  So glad I found this and the price is great too.  Win Win!
This is the best. A bottle goes a long way. My face looks and feels fresh after using. There is no  sticky feeling and the smell is pleasant. I put a little in my hands then rub it on my face. After I rub my hands with what's left on them. I love it!!
"Llego rápido, el producto es muy bueno es un tónico que deja la piel de la cara muy hidratada y previa al maquillaje de muy buena calidad cero grasosa"
Use it all the time. Works great!
Sensitive skin! Always react... but my skin loves this! Use after shower every day before moisturiser and can see the difference immediately... hydrating & soothing... lush smell and refreshing.
Toller feuchtigkeitsspendender Toner - Benutze ihn bei meiner Skincare als ersten Schritt und liebe ihn.
"This flared up some eczema spots on my face, I have avoided those areas and use on other spots on the face and it does the trick. I have found better but for the price this is great."
"Son&Park has a great toner that is soothing, has a light unoffensive scent, and does a great job. Will continue using this as it is my new favorite toner!"
"I been using this toner for years, I always have one bottle within my skin care routine regardless if I have another toner on my table, smell almost like nothing, is super refreshing and hydrated my skin really well after my cleansing, having a mild exfoliating properties is super friendly use and zero irritating, my skin love it and absorb the product like a charm. I will repurchase this toner again and again. Highly recommended."
Love this 🫶🏻
"I do like this face toner.  Goes on clean, no irritation to my face.  Helps reduce my pores."
I like the scent and easy to clean my skin
"A bit more astringent than I remember, but seems to work fine. My face does feel a bit tight afterwards."
Been using Son&Park's Beauty Water for several years.  It makes my skin feel amazing!  Highly recommend!
"I'd heard the hype for years. Finally spent the coin and oh how it's giving what it needed to give. This is the toner that fits right in between ""is this even doing anything?"" and ""but why is my face on fire?"" Perfect 1st cleanse *or the only cleanse on the go or a lazy night*. Great as a toner to calm & clarify the skin, preparing it to better recieve your serums, moisture and makeup. Beauty Water has joined my top 5 toner list! A++++"
J'aime beaucoup !!
I have used this product for over 4 years and I love that it works well on my skin.It cleanses and makes my skin feel fresh.I have not reacted to this product.
"Amazing toner, keeps my skin clean feeling refreshing and moisturized. Hardly has a scent and the size is perfect for me."
I liked this product because it’s very light and gives soothing experience while applying. It doesn’t have any alcohol in it which is great and provides calmness to the screen. Only disadvantage that it doesn’t come in spray bottle.
"Only stuff that works for me, I have even tried prescription strength medication. This has been a gamechanger. I highly recommend!"
Love the smoothness of this product! Leaves my skin so fresh and hydrated and non greasy!
"Got this after an aesthetician’s recommendation for helping to reduce pore size.  I’ve been using it about a month now and haven’t noticed much difference in my pore size, but it does give a nice clean feeling to the skin.  Not harsh like astringents."
I absolutely love this for my skin. It make my skin feel so clean and soft. I wish I’ve gotten it sooner. It’s definitely a must in my skincare.
"I’ve used nutragena toner forever? Well, now it $48 for a bottle, no way! After reading reviews I decided to give it a try. I’m impressed by the way my skin feels. I work in food service so I get breakouts as an adult. My skin really feels great, no breakout! The bottle is good if you’re careful on pumping it. The 1st time I had some mess but I’m careful & only need 1-2 pumps. I think I found my new toner, & having the serum in with it is a bonus. Try it, you’ll be happy with this unique product. Love it!"
"This product works well. I like the smell, keeps my face feeling clean and fresh. The clear genius line from bliss overall is great. The only issue with this product is that the pump on the container does not work, I had to find another pump bottle to use."
Use this toner in my morning routine.  It's interesting how once applied it seems to blur your skin.  It doesn't claim that but my daughter as well has noticed that. Skin feels very soft.
You ever wash your face and think it’s clean? It’s probably not LOL. I use after cleansing 2 times and it removes whatever I missed! It feels so fresh and clean- also does not dry me out! Almost feels hydrating! Just try it!
Nice non irritating
I really enjoy this product the fact they've merged a toner and serum into one and its gentle has my attention! The pump works fine I found the texture a little daunting the first two uses however what I found helpful was to pump approx 1/² pump onto the pump then tip the gel onto clean fingers or a cotton round once I get it on I slightly fold the cotton round in half without squeezing it so the gel 'sticks' and then I swipe. Sounds like a process but it's barely a 2 second action. I find that it helps it spread much better across the face because it's covering more of the cotton round and it isn't slippery. I don't find there to be any overpowering scent or irritation. Having reactive sensitive skin this is a rare find for me. I would recommend this to anyone but even more so to those younger people with acne or blackheads as it is still so gentle. Even if you're just applying it directly on the affected areas only I'm sure you will see results without further damage to your skin.
"I first got this product as trial earlier this year and now I’m hooked! It’s the perfect amount of moisture, it’s not greasy, and it’s long lasting. I’ve never seen a toner clear up dry patches so quickly and effectively! It’s a little pricey but this bottle will probably last you a year. Side bar, I recommend putting it in your hand and rubbing it on your face as opposed to using a cotton swab because it will waste less product."
I love this toner! It instantly moisturizes my skin.
My first time using this product and took a chance. No matter the season my face and neck tend to be dry. I am not a fan of heavy face moisturizers and this toner is light and goes on quickly keeping my face completely moisturized. Great value as well!
The Korean line has it all together.
"Cool down my face, smell refreshing"
"I like it. I feel like it helps cool my skin, I live in a hot southern states so it's a must when washing my face after being outside."
I have both oily and dry face and it really helps keeps my face both refreshed and not as shiny. I usually use it before i go to sleep so it helps for the next day when i put make on. It really prevents my face from drying out. I used to use it as pre makeup solution but it doesn't really hold for that purpose.
"I got this product from an Avon rep, I liked it so much that I ordered one on Amazon. I use it anytime after make up, unlike the fact that it does not dry my skin. I am very happy with this product."
I love Belif products. Calming effect on the skin. Very good for dry skin like mine as I get older. Wish there was more of their products on Amazon.
"Ich bin sehr zufrieden, der Toner ist sehr cool, aber leider zu teuer.."
Ottimo.
I like this toner because I have combination skin and it hydrates the parts that are dry but doesn’t put too much moisture into the oily parts. If feels fresh and clean.

"As a college student, I just recently started to learn that there was more to a skin care routine than just washing your face. I decided to look into getting into a skin care routine and wanted to invest in a product that was vegan and cruelty free.Not only do I feel good about the results it has on my skin, but I also feel good about the amount of money that I am paying for the product. Although it is a bit pricey, and the product portion is small, I have found that a little bit goes a long way.When I apply the toner, I use just a few drops throughout my face and use a face roller to work it into my skin. The product does not smell bad, nor does it sting or dry out my skin. Within just a week of starting to use this toner, I noticed that my skin was overall clearer looking, and also felt a lot cleaner and less oily.I even got comments from others that my skin looks great. Because of this, I decided to invest in the full-size brightening serum that Farmacy sells. It just came in today and I already love it as well. I will definitely be re-purchasing from this brand again."
been using for years now
"I bought this for plane travel (because the size worked for tsa) and ended up loving it more than my regular salicylic acid toner. The bottle is substantial - it is kind of heavy glass (so ended up being a little silly for travel), but looks very nice on my vanity and feels very ""quality"". The opening has a little plug stopper thing, so while heavy, it was safe in my travel bag (no leaks).The product itself is fantastic - removes all leftover dirt, tightened my pores (I have big ones naturally and this does help minimize), refreshed my skin. It was not moisturizing and you will need to add moisture afterward (as is the case with any chemical exfoliant)!!!! My skin looks brighter and less congested after about a month or so of regular daily use. I am very pleased with this and will probably keep using it going forward (contingent on my budget, lol!)."
"It's probably the best toner I've used. It doesn't leave any ""film"" or residue, it just leaves a nice clean feeling. It's fresh and not overly drying and I do enjoy using it. However, I cannot justify spending $34 on a tiny 4 ounce bottle that's gone in a month!"
"This is so good to get grime off—I live in a big city and walk to work. By the end of the day my face is SO GROSS, covered in the pollution from cars and buses and life. This really cleans me up. However, my dermatologist warned me not to use it every day because it is a bit intense so I swap it out. Still love it when I use it, and it doesn’t give me eczema flares or dry skin :)"
I think it was worth the buy. I feel like the toner works really well for closing pores. I saw a change first try so I recommend this product.
"For reference I have fair colored oily skin and live in a dry climate. I’m a skincare junkie and have tried tons of products. I use a BHA exfoliating toner daily to keep my oily skin from breaking out.I enjoyed this toner in terms of the feel and scent. The scent is very light, like a hint of woody/echinacea. The texture is liquid - not the thick type of liquid that Glow Recipes PHA Essence  has, but more of the normal liquid that you would expect from a toner.It’s not sticky or tacky when applied, and my skin absorbed it quickly. It layered fine under my serum. Since I use toner for specifically keeping my face clear from breakouts, I can’t speak to whether this is brightening. But again, that wasn’t my objective with it. Since pores can’t really be “minimized” I tend not to care about their size but rather whether they are clear or not. This toner kept my pores nice and clear, and as a result it kept my skin looking even and matte.Overall it’s a good quality exfoliating toner. It’s not my holy grail, but I would say it’s in my top 3 favorites for exfoliating toners."
I enjoy this product. I've bought it a few times now and haven't found anything I like better yet.
"been using this for years!!! my go toner, can’t live without it!"
"I was looking for a BHA pore cleansing toner breakout due to combination/oily skin that's prone to breakouts. Only used for a few days but already notice radiant complexion and glowy skin. During my skincare routine, I pour out a small amount into a reusable cotton pad and swipe it all over my face, focusing on areas where I'm most acne-prone. I was experiencing a pretty awful bout of hormonal acne all over my chin, recently, but luckily the combination of this addition to my routine did the trick to essentially eradicate all the unwelcome visitors on my face.I love how this product isn't full of fragrance like a lot of other high-end toners and BHA products I've tried. I think that the fact that it includes more gentle, moisturizing ingredients like papaya and moringa, makes it a great option even if you tend to be sensitive to strong BHA products."
The deep sweep toner has changed the look of my skin! It cleans out my pores so well and it literally blurs my pores! I have also noticed that redness associated with my rosacea has been reduced since I started using it. I highly recommend!
I baught this along with other products from the same range. It's a really nice toner and i noticed a difference in the size of my pores within a week.It smells very clean and refreshing and is a good size bottle
"I use 10-12drops in the palm of my hand and apply this all over my face, neck and chest. My skin looks brighter, kp spots on my neck are getting smaller. I wanted to try PC's, but this is 1/3 the price for the same ingredient. I look forward to seeing what the end result of the 1st bottle looks like. Suspect I'll be repurchasing."
I use this daily as a toner on my normal skin that occasionally breaks out. It is very gentle and does not dry my skin out. Super price too for the amount of product. I think this brand is underrated.
I prefer this as a toner instead of witch hazel. Witch hazel burns my eyes and this doesn’t.
This is the only toner/exfoliant that my skin can handle! I use it every morning and its the only product that keeps my pores clean while gently exfoliating. Doesn't irritate my skin at all.
This toner was not irritating and worked well to assist my teens skin. I always suggest using the whole system together so every product works as it was formulated to. This brand has been highly recommended and we weren’t disappointed when trying it!
i had purchased this product because i saw people recommending it on tiktok but i felt no difference i nmy skin or saw any difference. it really isnt doing anything for my skin. it has a funny smell too (not a bad one). would return if i could since i had used it and opened it already.
this is a great toner. I have always suffered from oily skin all my life. I have not had any breakouts or irritation and I'm using this toner every evening. 100% recommend.
I have a problem with the clogged pores on my nose. This product has helped me so much to unclog my pores and make them smaller to what they are supposed to look like. I use it every other day after my shower. Works like magic!
This product has been on the market for nearly 100 years… great hydration and highly recommended by my dermatologist.  I use it morning and at night with just a little on a cotton ball and it actually now has done away with very fine lines.  So glad I can actually have it shipped by Amazon. In the past I would only get it from Amazon at a Whole Foods store… but now Amazon will send out.  Definitely a win-win!
Great toner. Gives me that refreshed feeling I need. Cools my skin off and leaves my skin glowing. I will purchase a bigger size once I finish with this one. Always wanted to try Thayers. Glad I did. My daughter used it too. I purchased one for her as well and she loves it. We both do.
"I love Thayers witch hazel, but I dislike the smell of roses so I've avoided the brand for a few years. This cucumber toner is AMAZING. It smells fresh (not perfumed) and makes my skin happy. Thank the heavens that this product comes in scents other than rose."
"I like it , it leaves my face smooth and bright"
"Great to find my favorite in a travel sized!I absolutely swear by witch hazel, this is my favorite brand and I like to travel with it. Discovered this on Amazon and purchase for my trip. I absolutely love this brand."
"I use this product daily and love it.  After taking off make up, I clean my face with this.  Feels great.  I didn't realize I bought a small bottle so will get the larger size next time.  The size I bought is perfect for traveling."
Feels great on fresh washed skin! Very soothing and relaxing. Smells great and feels so good after use. These are great products. Great prices too!  Check out more of their fabulous skin care at their Amazon Store.
"The toner itself it’s great, I can just never enjoy the full bottle because it LEAKS when I travel even when it’s shut and even when I only carry-on!!!!! Because of this I will be switching toners. The cap is just not reliable."
"bought this to try it out before committing to a bigger bottle, i like it and now reuse the smaller bottle for when i travel."
"Es gibt mehrere Größen, daher aufpassen bei der Bestellung und den Preis beachten ."
Me gustó mucho cómo deja mi piel. La siento verdaderamente limpia luego de usar él producto. Lo único es que tengo piel mixta y siento que me deja algo pegajoso al final
I like that it is alcohol free and it’s fragrance.

"The Good Molecules Glycolic Exfoliating Toner is a fantastic addition to any skincare routine. With glycolic acid, it effectively exfoliates and promotes cell turnover, leaving your skin feeling refreshed and smooth. Hyaluronic acid and aloe provide much-needed hydration and soothe the skin, making it perfect for daily use. The formula strikes a great balance between effective exfoliation and gentle care. Highly recommended for those seeking clearer, more radiant skin!"
"I love how this helps my skin texture and makes it brighter. Also, it’s great at fading some of old acne scars. It’s my favorite exfoliating toner. I use this in the morning and night to get off the dead skin cells. Before I used to use the Elf Yellow Toner, but they stopped selling it."
"This is a great glycolic toner that works as well as any other I've tried.  It is very inexpensive and lasts a long time.  I like the bottle/dispenser.  I use it all over my face and apply with my fingertips or a cotton ball and if I have a blemish, I will dab it with this toner a few times a day.  It doesn't irritate my skin or burn, and I have super sensitive skin."
"When I use this consistently I can tell a difference in my skin texture. It definitely feels smoother, reduces the appearance of pores and just overall evens out my skin tone."

"So far we love this! It works well for so many things, doesn’t burn or over dry and we love that it is a CLEAN product to use."
I absolutely love this stuff. I've had it for so long and still have so much left. My skin has gotten a lot better since using this. I've never used a toner before and I really like this one.
"I’ve been using this every day at night for almost 2 weeks now, and my skin has never felt this smooth and all blemishes are starting to fade.A little bit goes a long way — you damp a cotton pad and pour in maybe 2-3 drops and you can use it for your entire face and neck. Start small if this is your first time using AHA since it might cause irritation. And make sure to use sunscreen!!!I’ve tried many expensive cosmetic brands, and this is the first product that works without the ridiculous price tag and unnecessary ingredients. I’m very satisfied with my purchase and have recommended this to my friends and family."

Excelente calidad
Super.  Face like a baby's.
"I have been using these products for years and cannot say enough good things about them. My skin transforms immediately upon first use. Not 2 or 3 or a dozen uses, but first use.  I am a devoted and happy customer for life!"
I’ve been using this for a year or longer and truly love how it makes my skin feel so clean!
Wonderful product
Great toner
I don’t usually like toners. They feel too tightening and almost burning or blocking moisturizing. This one is soft and feels as if it helps my moisturizers serums/oils sinks in. Love it. And the smell is awesome.
I really liked this product for myself. I’ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now and I’ve seen a pretty noticeable change in my face. I do pair this with two other products for my night time skin care routine and I’ve definitely seen a huge difference. So far I am really enjoying it.
The product works great!!Unfortunately whoever decided to place the unremovable labels over the product instructions was a yutz.Fix the situation. Poor marketing strategy. I couldn’t get the label off.
Loved that there were multiple scents. Definitely made my face feel smoother and completely moisturized. I was surprised at at how much it made my face feel cool while wearing. Very good quality. A value for the money. Would definitely recommend.
"This sheet mask set is hydrating and refreshing. Each mask leaves your skin feeling soft, nourished, and glowing. With a variety of formulas, it’s perfect for pampering and addressing different skin needs."
"I have pretty sensitive skin and these have been wonderful! They are hydrating and my skin has never looked better. I have used one every few days and will definitely order more because the price is great! Some reviews say they don't notice a difference in smells but I don't smell much on them except the rose one really smells like rose. They for my giant forehead and down under my chin and have plenty of product in the bag to spread on my neck,chest and back of my hands."
"The masks are easy to apply and fit comfortably on the face, delivering a generous amount of serum that leaves the skin feeling hydrated and refreshed. The quality of the ingredients is noticeable, with many masks containing beneficial components like hyaluronic acid, vitamins, and natural extracts."
"I love these!!!!! I buy them on repeat, and I love having a variety so that I can pick and choose what I want for my skin at the time of use. They always provide good moisture and relaxation as well as comfort. I have sensitive skin and they have never caused me any sort of irritation, pain, or redness which some masks have done in the past. They keep well if you store them in a cool dry place and are a good value for the money! I see a difference in my skin with them and I look forward to using them! I highly recommend :)"
"Bought these for my younger cousin and she loves them. They were a great value for my money as I got 12 of them for a small price, and they were a good size even for me. They performed very well for her and left her skin moisturizer and clean after only one use. She doesn't have any visable pores yet. I imagine these would help a LOT with those. Overall a great product."
actually really like these face masks pretty hard to find actual good ones. i love these actually
Loved these masks and always leave my face feeling so fresh! Can't beat the price!
I like the masks 👍🏼
I’ve bought countless facial products and never found one I love more than these! I bought the variety pack and have already reordered. I keep them in the refrigerator and use 3-4 times a week for 20 minutes. The price can’t be beat and my face has never felt or looked better! Will definitely be ordering even more.
These are fantastic!! My skin feels so soft!! I also use after dermarolling because it's so soothing. I love the variety in the pack
"As a Korean, I've tried just about every popular Korean face mask out there, and I have to say, this one is fantastic! To be honest, I was a bit skeptical at first because the brand is new to me and the price is so affordable, especially compared to well-known Korean brands like Mediheal. But it delivers results that are just as good, if not better.After using this mask, my skin feels incredibly smooth and looks noticeably more radiant. I've never had any breakouts or irritation from it. Also, since I started using this product, I haven't purchased any of the more expensive Korean masks because this one is just as good as those expensive Korean masks. I highly recommend this mask if you're looking for effective skincare without breaking the bank."
These marks are nice. They are worth the money for how many come in the pack. They fit somewhat well but you have to be laying down or they will kind of fall off. It does feel refreshing when I take them off and I can see my skin looks brighter. The masks themselves are thick and don’t have a strong scent.
"DERMAL 24's Combo Pack A Collagen Essence Korean Face Mask offers an excellent value for the price. These masks are packed with beneficial ingredients, including collagen, which is known for its ability to improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of fine lines.One of the standout features of these masks is their YUKA rating of 76/100. This indicates that the ingredients used are generally safe and non-harmful for the skin. This is reassuring for those who prioritize using natural and gentle skincare products.Overall, the DERMAL 24 Combo Pack A Collagen Essence Korean Face Mask is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for an affordable and effective way to pamper their skin. The combination of quality ingredients and reasonable price make it a worthwhile investment."
Quality is not bad. It makes the skin glow after use. Don’t feel sticky while using. I’ve been repurchasing for so ma y times.
"This is my third year buying these masks. I typically have very dry skin in winter months. Whenever I use these masks, my face feels so hydrated and stays dewy and moist for days.  My makeup goes on smoother and more evenly after using this. The ingredients are not irritating. The mask unfolds and covers all areas well. There is extra liquid in the package that you can save for the next few days if you want to use it for continuous hydration."
"I’m a little disappointed as the reviews have been good for these masks.  I have tried two different ones and for me, unfortunately they are just ok.  They left my face feeling a little tight and I felt like it leaves a  film on my face.  Maybe it’s just me but for reference I’m 61 years old with normal skin ( not very dry or oily)."
"Noticable change in my skin after one use. Skin felt soft and smooth. Light scent, not over powering. Great price too!"
Very refreshing face mask
この商品が1番合ってる気がします。パックした次の日の朝の鏡を見るのが楽しみです。
First time using dermal masks and this product very nice and for very good value (cheaper than what is in stores). Will buy again.
Love these Korean dermal face masks.  I use one every night before bed.  Variety packs are fantastic.  My skin feels great and looks so much better now  than when I used to use some of the other products out there that are so much more expensive. I would highly recommend
"I followed the directions, and used a serum before applying. It does move a tiny bit, but if you’re patient and hold it in places it doesn’t stick well, like your eye sockets by your nose, it will eventually do its thing within a short time.The mask is large enough, but still small to where there are gaps of your face that go uncovered. I used the mouth, and eye pieces to cover the tiny areas of my face that the mask didn’t reach. Even overlapping the mask, my skin still absorbed everything. I have sensitive, and dry skin with semi-large pores. There is a distinct smell, but it didn’t bother me or my skin at all. When applying, the mask will be surprising more slippery coming from the package than when placing on your face. You do need to be careful with the mask, because it can be easily punctured or ripped if you are too rough trying to get it to reach beyond its limits. However, it easily goes back to its form if you don’t completely rip it, so just be careful. Punctures aren’t the end of the world and don’t change the efficiency of the mask.After taking it off the next morning, I did see the difference between the skin on my face the mask reached, to the skin it didn’t. The mask made my skin hydrated, and softened my tired eye bags along with other tiny lines on my face. As other reviewers have mentioned, it does leave your skin shiny yet feeling sticky. I just splashed my face with water to make it less sticky from the mask residue, and that was enough for me to feel okay.Overall, I recommend for occasional use, not daily or even weekly at their price point. There are other products that will absorb collagen into your skin much better, and cover your whole face without taking hours. However, if you have a special next-day occasion, or just want to pamper yourself because your skin needs the extra hydration, I do recommend mixing these in with your routine."
"I saw so much hype over these masks and similar versions that it was hard to believe they could live up to the rave reviews.But I have to say, these masks are really lovely. Not only do they leave my skin hydrated and smooth, but the experience using them is so enjoyable.Highlights:-no off-putting scent-plenty of serum (I apply the excess from the packaging to my neck and chest)-easy to apply-stays in place-noticeable results-comfortable to sleep in-feels cooling on the skin (even long after application)Con (only one):-tears easily, so handle carefullyYou can wear these overnight or for several hours during the day. Unless you move a ton in your sleep, you can sleep in these masks easily and they’ll stay in place.The cooling sensation when you wear this mask is incredibly soothing. I tried popping it in the refrigerator and that further elevated the experience.I highly recommend these masks. They’re a re-buy for me, and I suggest them to all of my friends and family."
"I absolutely love these face masks! They leave my skin feeling super moisturized and give me a beautiful, healthy glow. The best part is how versatile they are—you can wear them all day or even sleep in them for an overnight hydration boost. I wake up with soft, refreshed skin every time!These masks have become a must-have in my skincare routine, especially when my skin needs that extra bit of TLC. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an easy way to pamper their skin!"
"The mask ripped while I was gently taking it out of the bag so I had to piece it together to make it fit my skin, utilizing the section that overlapped on my cheek. About three hours later the sides started to dry up and lifted from my skin. After use, my skin was youthful, plump and moisturized. I was extremely impressed, just wished it lasted more than two days."
"I’ve been using the Biodance collagen mask for a few weeks now, and I absolutely love it! It leaves my skin feeling deeply hydrated and refreshed after each use. The mask is very gentle on my sensitive skin, and I noticed an improvement in the texture and overall glow of my face. It’s also easy to apply and fits well without slipping off. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a boost of hydration and a smoother complexion!"
"Imagine waking up next to this scary face on the plane! 😂 but really hydrating mask, absorbed in 3 hours completely and left skin feeling glowy, smooth, hydrated. It did slip a bit and the mouth piece on the lips is a bit extra but honestly great results."
"-The item sent to me does not match the photos-It also says ""Made in China"" when Biodance is made in Korea-There is no ""Biodance"" logo or name on the package-The package doesn't match what's shown in the photos-This appears to be a fake Biodance product?"
My skin is very soft and my face is glowing after using this mask.
Super

"Bought couple packs for my spouse to test.  Although price seems high but positive effect on the skin is obvious and she was really impressed by results.  Looking forward to buy more. There quite a few cheap and not so imitations on the market,  better be careful and ensure that it's original product when buying."
"Love these masks, Very easy to use you can just walk around and get things done with them and not even remember you’re wearing them. They make your skin feel great. I would definitely buy more."
"mi favorita es la miel, las recomiendo 100%"
"Great assortment, they were easy to use and made our skin feel super fresh and clean!  Definitely worth the value!"
It give my face a smooth feeling and leave it moisturizing.
I use these masks twice a week. They’ve left my face feeling soft and moisturized. It’s not sticky after.
It s good quality good value of the money
I love this product it refreshes my skin and leaves it looking supple and clean.It's a carefully thought out skin care brand . Real value for money ..
"Just received it and can't wait to use them. However, did not receive 12."
Love that all 14 are different. Use a lot of masks and these stick really nice so you can keep on moving and grooving. Great feel and adds so much hydration. A little thinner than some but I think it works to stay on better. In the pack the mask comes on a piece of plastic so just be ready for that. Used the sake and tomato so far. No smell and pleased with performance and value.
I love how it had the plastic piece of the face mask so it’s easy to remove and doesn’t get all bundled up when you put it on.Very relaxing and great flavors for different forms of relaxation and a variety of areas to treat
"Price per mask is ok.  There actually are some that are cheaper at $0.50 per mask, but then I'd have to buy way too many.This has a nice variety.The lotion is a bit watery, runny.  The mask itself is thin.  (some come stating that they are thicker).  But the pictures give a clear indication of what to expect.I am honestly NOT a huge mask wearer.  Personally, I prefer a good moisturizing cream that I can just lather all on my face.  But I get these for family gatherings.  I honestly do it as a photo shoot event - guys and gals.  Plus, it is a funny thing to do after a big meal.  The men actually get a kick out of it because they don't often do this at their home.The problem with masks in general is that they are so big, and I don't like the wet liquid dripping into my eyes.  But once stretched and put on, and aligned around the eyes, they are fine."
"Very good quality! Adding it to my skin care routine occasionally helps leave my skin feeling extra moisturized, perhaps a bit firmer as well. I definitely like the variety that this product gives for face masks as far as smells. Definitely worth the purchase!"
I have sensitive skin and these masks really moisturizes the skin
"This was a good deal I got the box fast, it has all of them accounted for and I like that there are different ones to try. They feel nice when I'm having a pamper day. Easy to use."
So these where party favors for my daughters slumber party but for whatever reason all the girls skin burned and broke up a day later .
"If you have any kind of facial issues from dryness, oiliness, large pores, sensitive skin, or anything else, this 14 pack variety may help you.  You receive 2 of each of the 14 flavors of facial masks.  Having a girl's weekend?  This would be perfect to bring with you.  The masks did cause irritation of my skin.  I cannot say it solved all of my issues, but my skin did feel nice after using the mask."
Nice skin care product - daughter liked the cleanser - good value - moisturizing
"For the past 6-7 years, my cheeks would randomly get painfully dry and extremely red.I’ve tried the turmeric and rose and so far I really like this mask! My face feels very smooth and my cheeks have gotten a lot less red/bumpy and I’ve only used this product for 2 days.This mask also smells good and the size seems small, but for the price this is pretty good value - especially because you really don’t need to use much at one time.This mask also comes off like lotion with water! It doesn’t crust or clump like other clay masks when you wash it off!"
"Pros are the quality pots of 3 facial masks/muds, the ingredients that seem to work without any skin issues, the effect on skin, they way skin feels and looks after masks have been on. Cons, the spatula trash, use it to put clays on hands, then spread, leave on before bath time, as a bit harder to remove/cleanse unless combined with a liquid cleanser or even toner. Small jars, but price was fair on deal. Will order again. The turmeric one brightened my skin and took a lot of impurities out. Avocado smoothed and softened. Not a lot of scent, a good thing in this case. After a week give a half star extra as have been using every other day and my skin is glowing! I have difficult skin as 55 and perimenopausal, but so far all three types have worked well for me. The rose is so hydrating that after rinsing my skin is baby soft! Love different about all 3 (still a fan of the turmeric brightening and tightening). This is not incentivized in any way, but I truly think these are a big hit!"
I love the product.. It comes with a  cspatula so you can apply it to your face neatly without getting all over your fingers. The mask is very smooth and silky when you rinse you notice how silky your skin feels immediately after using this product.  I love it.
Ty so very much this product is amazing!!
"I got my 3 pack of clay face masks and used it 1-2 days later. The price is pretty good for the amount you get. All three types/colors of the masks were somewhat difficult to get on the spatula that comes with it and is pretty difficult to spread around on your face. It is pretty solid and not creamy so its difficult to spread evenly. There is no artificial scent. I had no stinging or irritation from using this product, but I'm generally not allergic to things and don't have very sensitive skin so I can't really speak for that. It dries pretty well once you are able to get it on. When it came time to remove it, it took a while to remove. There was no dryness afterward but I also used a really nice moisturizer directly after patting dry with a towel. The skin problems I got this product for was acne and fine lines and wrinkles but I haven't used the product long enough to see any benefits to my skin. If there is any real improvement due to this product I will update this review but so far, I don't see anything special about these masks yet."
LEAVES SKIN INCREDIBLE
"I would say that this product is perfect for people on the fence with skincare. I originally bought this thinking it would be a waste of money that I would never use, but after using it a couple times I can’t get enough of it. My skin is softer than before and glows!"
"A pele fica ótima. Só usei dois deles, mas já deu pra ver o resultado."
la calidad es muy buena la he estado usando y el tacto que tiene y los resultados en la piel son notorios respecto a otras cremas. Huelen super bien y es ideal para el cuidado facial
"Die Masken sind super angenehm auf der Haut und einfach aufzutragen.Ich verwende die Masken einmal wöchentlich (nach der Dusche, immer abwechselnd) und lasse sie ca. 20 bis 30 Minuten auf der Haut. Anschließend wasche ich es mit lauwarmen Wasser wieder ab.Nach der Anwendung ist die Haut super weich und fühlt sich frisch und sauber an. :-)Alles in allem bin ich zufrieden und freue mich!"

"These 16 collagen essence masks came in a resealable clear plastic bag. Each one was different! I was amazed at the variety of masks. The shipping was also fast (they came in two days!!)Here's what I got:Aloe, Royal jelly, Herb, Cucumber, Vitamin (has picture of orange), Green tea, Collagen, Hyaluronate, Syn-nake (has picture of snake), Snail, Platinum, Gold, Pearl, Charcoal, Q10 coenzyme, and WhiteI tried the aloe mask first to help with my currently irritated skin. My skin is usually clear and nice, which people have complimented me on a bunch of times before. I only get acne when it's around that time of the month. Today, I had a few tiny pimples and the left side of my face was red and itchy from last night (probably because I slept on my face, which is a bad thing to do. From now on I'll keep sleeping on my back instead). I know that aloe helps with redness and sun burns, so that's why I chose this to try.I left the mask on for about 20-30 minutes and laid down on my bed. The mask is soothing and cool to the touch. It's also tingly in the beginning when I put it on. There wasn't any strong odor; it smells just like every other face mask I've used in the past from other brands. The mask easily fit my wide face. There's flaps on the masks to cover the eyelids if you want to. The mask was a nice shape - no problems with it at all.When I peeled the mask off, it still had a TON of essence, so I literally rubbed the mask on my neck, stomach, hands, arms, and legs because it has incredible moisture and I didn't just want to throw the mask away without getting the most of it! The redness on my left side of my face is still there but I think it improved a bit and isn't as noticeable now.I don't use face masks that frequently because I'm still a teenager and my skin doesn't have much problems. However, I use masks when I feel really stressed/tired or when I have a migraine and the masks have this therapeutic, relaxing effect. It's like a mini spa facial which you can do for super cheap and at home or on the go.Overall I was pleased with the quality and quantity of the masks. You get a good deal for this collection of collagen masks (16 masks for $8.39)People with drier, wrinkled skin can benefit more from this because of the abundance of essence inside the masks. If your skin is oily/normal, like mine, personally, I'd advise you to use this once a week or fewer times than that. A little goes a long way! I'll use a mask once a month or two.Note: I'll try to update this review every time I use a new mask to let you know what each one does.If this review helped you, please rate this as Helpful. Thanks!"
"I really like these masks. I decided to write a quick bit about each mask below. Note that all of the masks leave a sticky like residue. If you pat or rub the excess in the stickiness goes away. The stickiness is the collagen.Vegetable placenta - it has .5% damiana leaf extract. Smells like flowers with a hint of vanilla. Felt really calming and cool on the face when using it.Rose -has 2% rose water, by far my favorite mask of all of these. Smells like fresh roses, but not overwhelmingly so. Felt really calming and cleansing on my face.Grape - 1% grape extract, smells very lightly of grape juice or grape candy. Felt cool and perks up the skin.Apricot - 1% apricot extract. Smells likean apricot, literally. Felt calming and refreshing.Strawberry - 1% strawberry extract. Smells lightly of strawberries. Felt tingly a little, but also felt cool and clean.Wine- 1% wine extract. Smells like red wine but lightly. Felt replenishing and relaxing. Probably my second favorite of the bunch.Bamboo - 1% bambusa vulgans extract. Smelled like a spa, or like a forest after it rains. Was very moisturizing and relaxing. This one is nice to wear if you want a nap too because its so relaxing.Acai berry - 1% euterpe olercea fruit extract. Smells like berries. Felt very rejuvenating, a nice pick me up mask.Grape fruit and honey - 1% honey and 1% grape fruit extract. Smells mostly like wildflower joney with a citrus edge to it. A nice morning mask because it is very refreshing and has a kick to it.Seaweed - 1% seaweed extract. Perfumy ocean smell with earthy tones. Felt very clean and refreshing while wearing it.Acerola - 1% acerola extract. This is a south american cherry basically, so the smell is very cherry like. Felt refreshing and tingly but in a good way, like a wake up way.Milk - 1% milk protein. Perfumy smell, kinda a loke musty oder, but nothing bad. It was a very moisturizing mask.Pomegranate - 1% pomegranate extract. Smelled like pomegrante. Felt freshing and moisturizing. Was simlar to the apricot mask in terms of feeling.Red ginseng - 1% red ginseng extract. Very earthy smell with a spicey tinge. Was calming and rejuvenating.Bee venom - .5ppm bee venom. Smelled like spring flowers. Felt very zen and spa like because it had a very calming smell and had a clean feeling on the skin. Def another one of my favorites.Olive - 1% olive fruit extract. Least favorite in terms of smell. It had a very alcohol smell to it that also smelled salty in a way. I guess it makes sense cause its an olive. Regardless it did feel very moisturizing on the skin.Basically all of these wraps were overall good and worth the price. My skin felt more plump and awakened after using each mask. I used maybe 2 to 3 masks per week in the evening. Its a nice pick me up from a long day too.I didnt break out while using these, my skin type is a combo of oily and dry depending on the area.I would buy again"
"Tengo tiempo usándolas y aún no he encontrado cuál es la diferencia entre cada una de ellas, sin embargo mi cara está muchísimo más hidratada desde que las uso, es por eso que ya tengo por lo menos un par de años comprándolas y seguiré haciéndolo."
"Since I've been using these masks my skin has become ridiculously soft. It finally feels strong and nice.Having a skin that requires hypoallergenic products, I did have some slight reactions at first during some of the masks. However, these reactions went away quickly and I sincerely feel that it is due to the new level of hydration and health that my face was not used to. My skin is now beautiful and healthy, I recommend 100%."
"good product , have used all the different flavours, they smell amazing and do the job"
Awesome!
"Great range of masks, they smell very good. Great value for money and they make my skin feel hydrated and soft. Would definitely recommend!"

"Vitamin C Face Mask with Kaolin Clay and Turmeric: A ReviewProduct Overview: This Vitamin C face mask combines the power of Kaolin clay and turmeric to target dark spots and dull skin. It's designed to brighten the complexion, even out skin tone, and provide a radiant glow. The mask is suitable for various skin types and is often marketed as an anti-aging, brightening, and skin-rejuvenating product.Key Ingredients and Benefits:Vitamin C: Known for its antioxidant properties, Vitamin C helps protect the skin from free radicals, reduces the appearance of dark spots, and promotes a brighter, more even complexion. It also boosts collagen production, which can help improve skin elasticity and reduce the appearance of fine lines.Kaolin Clay: A gentle, fine clay that is less drying than other clays, Kaolin is effective at absorbing excess oil and impurities without stripping the skin of its natural moisture. It's suitable for sensitive skin and helps in gentle exfoliation, leaving the skin smooth and refreshed.Turmeric: This natural ingredient has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, which can help reduce redness, soothe irritated skin, and fight acne. Turmeric also has skin-brightening properties, making it effective in reducing dark spots and pigmentation.Hydrating Agents: Many versions of this mask include hydrating ingredients like aloe vera, hyaluronic acid, or glycerin to ensure that the skin does not feel too dry after use, providing a balanced skincare experience.Application: The mask is usually applied to clean, dry skin. A thin, even layer is spread over the face, avoiding the eye area. It is left on for about 10-15 minutes until it starts to dry but does not become too tight. Afterward, it's rinsed off with lukewarm water, and a moisturizer is applied to lock in hydration.Pros:Brightening Effect: The combination of Vitamin C and turmeric is effective at brightening the skin and reducing the appearance of dark spots and pigmentation.Gentle on the Skin: Kaolin clay is less harsh compared to other clays, making this mask suitable for sensitive skin types.Anti-Aging Benefits: Vitamin C’s collagen-boosting properties help in reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, providing a youthful glow.Anti-Inflammatory Properties: Turmeric helps soothe the skin, making it beneficial for those with acne or redness.Improves Skin Texture: Regular use can lead to smoother, more even skin texture, reducing the appearance of enlarged pores.Cons:Possible Staining: Turmeric can sometimes stain the skin or towels, so it's important to rinse thoroughly and use dark-colored washcloths when removing the mask.Potential Sensitivity: While Kaolin clay is gentle, some people may experience slight tingling or sensitivity due to Vitamin C or turmeric. It’s advisable to do a patch test before full application.Drying Effect: Even though Kaolin clay is milder, it can still have a drying effect, especially if left on too long. Following up with a good moisturizer is essential.Fragrance: Some masks may contain added fragrances, which can be irritating to sensitive skin. Checking the ingredient list for artificial fragrances is recommended.Conclusion: The Vitamin C Face Mask with Kaolin Clay and Turmeric is an excellent choice for those looking to brighten their complexion and address issues like dark spots and dullness. It harnesses the power of natural ingredients to provide a radiant, youthful glow while still being gentle on the skin. Ideal for people with normal to oily skin types, it offers a balance of exfoliation, oil control, and hydration. For those with dry or sensitive skin, using this mask sparingly and ensuring proper hydration post-use can help achieve the best results. Overall, it’s a versatile and effective addition to any skincare routine, delivering noticeable benefits with consistent use."
"I only gave it a 4 star because I haven’t used it much to see the pigmentation difference yet. However, this definitely feels good on my face after I wash. It’s smooth and soft I like the aftermath of it. Smells good too. No reaction for me slight tingle but nothing crazy. I will cont to follow the directions and keep using it."
"I recently tried the Vitamin C Face Mask with Kaolin Clay and Turmeric for addressing dark spots and dull skin, and I have to say it’s been a game changer for my skincare routine.First off, the combination of Vitamin C and turmeric really helped brighten my complexion. I have some stubborn dark spots and dull patches, especially after being out in the sun, but after using this mask regularly, I noticed a visible improvement. The Vitamin C seems to prevent further pigmentation, while the turmeric adds a nice, even glow to my skin, leaving it soft and radiant.The kaolin clay in the mask is great for controlling oil without being too harsh. I have combination skin, so I’m always hesitant about clay masks drying me out, but this one struck the perfect balance. My skin felt deeply cleansed without that tight, dry feeling. I also loved how the mask provided gentle exfoliation, making my pores look more refined and my skin feel smoother after each use.Another thing I appreciate is that this mask works for pretty much all skin types. My sister has dry, sensitive skin, and she also gave it a try without any irritation. The hydrating properties and the refreshing texture make it suitable even for sensitive or oily skin types.This product has definitely earned a permanent spot in my skincare routine. If you're dealing with dark spots, dullness, or oily skin, I highly recommend giving it a try!"
It feels fresh after user and didn’t give me any allergies or rosacea as I usually have with other masks. It’s subtle but effective!
The product came sealed but it seemed it was stored or Transported in a way where the seal was open not sure for how long. Still tried it and it burn and I couldn't handle the burn for more than 10 seconds
Im loving it
"Das auftragen mit dem Pinsel 🖌️, ist ein sehr angenehmes Gefühl, lässt sich super verteilen und während des auftragen der Maske, kühlender und entspannender Effekt für die Haut.Die Maske riecht sehr gut und hat eine super Konsistenz.Der kühlende Effekt bleibt bis zum Schluss.Die Maske lässt sich mit lauwarmen Wasser sehr gut entfernen. Das Gesicht fühlt danach seidig, frisch und geboostert an.Ich kann diese Maske für alle die eine empfindliche Haut haben, so wie ich, sehr empfehlen."
Ce masque tient vraiment ses promesses.Super achat
"Spoil yourself with this mask because it's cheap and it actually works!😭 I bought this years ago in my 20s, and then ended up buying it again now in my 30s. Not saying it didn't work the first time, I was just curious and was experimenting with other masks which is why I didn't continue getting this one. This came in last saturday and I WISH I took a before picture!! Because DAMN! WHAT A DIFFERENCE! SO, let me explain my face instead. I had alot of blemishes on my face, achne, even achne scars, strawberry pores, blackheads and its also naturally dry. I have freckles that run horizontally across my face, but I don't count those as blemishes. Freckles are just stars on skin,baby! Anyway, the minute this package came in. I wiped my face with Clearasil wipes, then washed my face with Clean&Clear deep action exfoliating scrub like I normally would. I finally applied this mask after I dried my face. It felt really good I loved that tightening feeling, and it dried pretty fast. It was easy to wash off too. The first day results were already visible. My skin was brighter, not dry. The blackhead feeling wasn't there anymore. It says use it twice a week so I used it friday night. First Clearasil, then applied this and I washed it off in the shower, but this time used my Clean&Clear wash after the mask. NOW there are obvious results. My face is brighter. My face was NOT DRY(wasn't oily either). No achne or scars, No blackheads, and my favorite part is the fact that my strawberry pores ARE GONE!! The only thing visible now on my face are my stars✨️😉. This mask truly minimized my pores!! This Dead Sea Mud Mask, brought my face to LIFE! I read more about the Dead Sea and turns out it helps eczema too. Whenever I have flare ups I will try to do a before and after pic with eczema atleast. This mask is awesome!! Get it! Get it! Treaaaat yo'self.🎉"
"My 56 year old face decided to break out in multiple places, totally out of the blue.  I used to use a charcoal mask by Origins, but I was out and live pretty far away from a department store, so Amazon to the rescue.This mud mask was exactly what I needed.  After reading several reviews I felt like I would do okay with the lavender scent.  It is a strong scent so be aware! I didn’t find it offensive, but I’m glad I didn’t pick the tea tree.It goes on smooth and feels wonderful on the skin.  I love how it gets a little crunchy as it dries too.  Removal is easy with a washcloth, but it’s harder to get it off the washcloth than your face.  Finally, it does leave a bit of “slickness” like soap on your face.  At first it was off putting, but I realized that’s just how it feels when it’s off.My face is slowly clearing up.  I’m using this mask 3x a week and don’t feel like it’s overly drying.  I’m happy with it and would recommend it."
"Skin felt great on first use.  So far no breakouts or itching or other irritation noted.  Soft, touchable skin."
This is a new kind of a mask. Its all natural and you can have the healing power of the black sea.It dries quickly and it's easy to remove it's effectiveness is outstanding.So you don't have to go to the black sea you can order it on Amazon.
"I was unsure of what to expect honestly, I haven't used many face masks. I'm beginning to notice wrinkles in my face so I figured it's best use collagen now! To start, the smell was really nice. Like an ocean breeze of some sort. The application was easy, it was a thick ""foam"" texture which was satisfying. After it dried I touched my face and the mask was insanely soft. After washing it off, my skin felt the same in the sense where it was insanely soft! I can't say much about the affects as it's only been one day, but so far so good!"
Someone took a bite of my face mask.I’ve had it for only a week so I don’t have much change but I’ll update the review when I do. I did notice pimples popped up after I used it? But I have no idea if that’s normal or not (this is my second mask ever). It did take a long time to wash it off.
This is easy to apply and leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped. Great value
Amazing formula really gentle on the skin but cleans effectively I recommend if you're looking for a face mask to cleanse your skin while minimizing the pores
Goste da leveza! Produto com eficiência magnífica. Recomendo!
"I have oily / combination skin, suffer with hormonal acne and am noticing more fine lines appearing. I used this last night for the first time and it left my skin feeling clean, soft, smooth and hydrated. It’s a lovely texture and has a lovely lavender fragrance. It doesn’t dry on the skin all tight like some other clay masks and it’s easily removed with a warm damp cloth. Very happy!"
It causes acne and destroy skin
Not worth
Came in a damaged cardboard box and covered in what looks like dust
"I was skeptical when I initially opened the product. The texture is thick, and a bit chunky - not what I was used to using as a face mask.It has a mild scent but nothing bothersome. It smells very natural.After testing the product quite a few times, I’ve found that it is pleasantly hydrating and skin-balancing. It gives a natural glow!Its very soothing and I love using this mask after doing extractions but before the rest of my skincare routine.This would be perfect for winter months when skin needs a little pick-me-up!Overall, amazing product and I will continue to use in my routine!"
"Usually I try to write reviews for future buyers and also for there to be a review stating the truth or opinion this face masks smells wonderful and the quality is great it did not scratch my skin it felt hydrating the spoon helped the application it only took me a minute to put the face mask on my face and after my skin was glowing and dewy and definitely moisturized it was very smooth when I put on the face mask and blended well which I loved I definitely recommend this product the application was easy , smells great , not harsh on skin, leaves skin hydrated and moisturized"
"This mask is a lifesaver for my dry, sensitive skin!  It's so gentle and hydrating, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I've been using it twice a week, and I've definitely noticed a difference in my pores and sebum production. Plus, it smells amazing!  Highly recommend this mask if you're looking for a gentle but effective way to care for your skin."
"I had been reading a lot about K-beauty products so thought of trying this out. The results are impressive. It is very hydrating and feel amazing. I’ve used it 3-4 times now and your skin feels bright after using. The skin does not feel dry at all. A small drawback is the smell. I am okay with it, but however if you are sensitive, I would think about it before getting this. The quantity is amazing as well. You just need a really small amount for your face, it comes with a small spoon/spatula to scoop out the product. So that’s great! Overall a good product."
"This is such a nice product, the smell was new to me, but once it was on my skin it smelled so so good. When I tell you, my skin was incredibly soft after just once use!!  I would definitely recommend it!!"
"I bought this as part of a multi step skin care routine to aid in improving my skin texture. I can say this product isn’t super harsh and feels soft and luxurious in my skin! It helps suck up that excessive sebum and gunk out of the pores! The honey in this product just feels like it’s calming my skin down. I have traditionally dryer skin, and I feel does my skin wonders, cleaning and leaving my face moisturized! Highly recommended for anyone who wants a good quality light weight mask."
Makes my skin feel soft afterwards. Also leaves a bit of a glow or brightening effect after washing it off. The scent is natural and not overbearing. I like using this mask whenever I want to wind down and add moisture back into my skin. Lovely mask!
It’s a super gentle mask that gives a little exfoliation when taking it off and gives an amazing glow. I use it in the morning a few times a week and I really do feel like my face is more moisturized and glowing afterwards. Will be buying again.
"No need to hustle with DIY rice masks, this one gets you covered."
amazing for skin
This face mask is very effective in keeping your face moisturized. Does not cause any discomfort to face when applying and has a cool touch. Very easy to use and it smells fine. Size fits any face and it makes your skin feel super clean afterwards. I would say the quality is amazing. Makes myvafce feeling smooth for days.
"I love these face masks! I use one every Sunday and they always leave my skin feeling super soft, smooth and hydrated. This is the best price I've found for them so far, as they can be kind of expensive when bought individually."
I love these face mask because they stay on the skin really well and dont move around. I use them once a week and my skin is so hydrated and soft.
"I used to use very expensive hydrating masks, but they never stayed on. This product stays on pretty well. Like other reviewers already wrote - the box of 12 (always) comes messed up (I've bought 4 so far), but the mask packets are always in perfect shape. And like another reviewer wrote - I couldn't figure out what to do with the eye flaps at first either - now I just leave them under the eye. (Of course with the lip flap you can't speak for the duration.)"
"I order 12. I have ordered 12 many times now. I received  one. Again.  Again.I love these masks. I pay for 12 yet again because I want them. And again, I am sent one.And for a return I have to spend half an hour driving across town.Once was fine- twice I could understand. We all make mistakes. And now I have ordered 12 face masks many times  because I love this product.I assumed the company would get its act together.They haven’t. I want this . I love these face masks。 I can’t order them because when I buy 12, I ALWAYS receive 1.Then I ask for a replacement and get the full 12x and if I don’t spend my time and energy to return the single mask, which takes a lot of my time, I then sm charged twice.Why can the company send correct replacements every time and fail to send my initial order correctly every time?  Because they get paid twice when O do t have time to drive thei single mask they send me?I haven’t found a better product. And I am done I assumed that ordering would get better. And  I have now received one  face mask while ordering and being charged for 12, so many times that I’m out over $200 and I hold active hate for Neutrogena.And I love these face masks. I eod have been a repeated and loyal customer and I gave them so many chances to just send what I purchased from them.I’m disappointed red that I can’t get their masks. I’m angry that I gave them the benefit of the doubt. And I’m angry that I have spent t my time and money either returning the single mask or not having the energy or time to return it and then being charged  for the (suspiciously always correct) 12 pack.Ordering something I want is not possible . Unless I am willing to spend half an hour returning g it and asking for a replacement EVERY time I try to order these.Why?!?"
"This mask is cut in half with a top half and lower half.  It is a gel or like a jelly feel.  A con of the mask is it is too small for my face.  The edges on my forehead, cheeks, and jawline do not get the mask coverage.  A plus of the mask is that it is non-comedogenic so it doesn’t clog your pores.  It moisturizes the are it covers.  It is somewhat difficult to apply but I’m still learning how to apply this cut in half and slippery mask.There is another mask on Amazon that I love but it’s not non-comedogenic so it could flog my pores.  It is one piece and easy to apply as well as covers my whole face.  So I just have to decide if this mask’s negative attributes are worth it being non-comedogenic.I might go back to the mask that is not non comedogenic and use pore stripping strips.  I will use all 12 of these gel masks and see if I notice a better outcome than when I used the other mask.  It will be a hard decision for me.  I don’t want my pores to clog up and get big.  But I’d like my whole face covered by the mask also.  I will decide on the best moisturizing performance of the 2 masks."
"I've tried lots of masks from lots of sources. These are basically my gold standard. I used these when I was going through chemo, to treat myself and also try to treat my skin as it was going through so much. Unlike other sheet masks where it's just like putting a piece of wet fabric on your face, these are gelatinous So they're a little bit hard to corral onto your face at first. But they leave my skin so hydrated it's incredible. Use the same brand of serum between using the mask and your skin will be super hydrated and glowy."
"Easy to use. Gives you hydration, no smell, feels nice"
"Hidrata muy bien la piel, los resultados son muy buenos"

Expensive for what it is but decent results my makeup sat nicely after using it.
Me encanta esta mascarilla. Es una excelente opción para hidratación

"Used for a slumber party, one child broke out in hives from the green tea mask."
Very good it was nice for me and hydrated my skin even tho I’m 9 I don’t get allergic to these very nice
"Really nice product, no itching, no irritation, good moisturising."
"J'ai déjà commander ce produit, et ma petite fille était très très contenteJe recommande"
Ich habe sie für meine Tochter gekauft. Die Motive sind niedlich.Sie riechen toll und frisch.Auftragen ließen sie sich gut und wir haben sie gut vertragen. Meine Tochter ist 6 und fand toll das sie eigene hatte. Für den Spaß gerne wieder. Insgesamt finde ich sie aber zu teuer.
MUY BIEN
Cheap when bought in bulk. Feels nice on your face.
These feel so good on & afterwards.  There are pretty slimy & sometimes hard to get off the plastic backing but once I get it fixed in place it is a very moisturizing face mask. Good value & highly recommended.
"Love it , I will repurchase it . Very moisturizing for skin. And also smell good, natural plants and flowers flavor ! Highly recommended for you"
The title says it all ^~^
"I am thoroughly enjoying this set of masks. The fact that there are different masks for different results that you’re looking for, whether it be hydration or brightening. Took it on a long flight with me and I could feel my face hydrated after the mask."

Love these for random gifts parties etc!
"I purchased these because they were cheap compared to other brands. It’s true what they say, ‘You get what you pay for.’ When you’ve used even moderately priced Korean sheet masks, you realize that these don’t even begin to stack up. The ingredients list are very below basic and missing a lot of what I consider to be the bare minimum in a decent sheet mask that is beneficial for your skin. That’s not to say that the ingredients (at least in my experience) are damaging. They don’t appear to be, though I do experience a tiny bit of stinging when I use certain ones. I’m used to cooling, refreshing masks that help soothe my skin. These aren’t terrible for that, but definitely not what I’m used to. The masks do provide some hydration, but I would still use a moisturizer after you take the mask off if you have drier skin like I do. I’m not a dermatologist, but I wouldn’t recommend this as the backbone of your skincare routine…just because these masks lack basic beneficial ingredients and nutrients for your skin.The good things? The variety, for one and the sheer volume of masks for the price. They fit perfectly, but if you have a larger face, you might have to make some cuts in the sheet to make it fit your face. I enjoy fragrance and am not sensitive to it. These have very little scent. It’s not a dealbreaker for me.All in all, there are better sheet masks out there. Yes, they cost a little more, but if you’re going to spend the money anyway, you should get something that’s good for your skin as opposed to just neutral. Since they don’t hurt my skin and at the very least provide hydration, I’ll probably use all 240 of them, and then go back to my usual, tried and true Korean mask brands, and steer clear from the Chinese made ones like these.I’m sorry, folks. I wanted to give these a fair chance and a fair review, but the quality just isn’t there."
"I am absolutely in love with the COSRX Snail Mucin Mask! From the first use, my skin felt hydrated, plump, and incredibly soft. The snail mucin is a miracle ingredient—it calms any irritation and gives my skin a beautiful, dewy glow.The mask fits well, adheres perfectly to my face, and feels so soothing while it’s on. After removing it, I can see a noticeable difference in the texture and brightness of my skin. It also leaves behind the perfect amount of essence without feeling sticky or greasy.This mask has become a regular part of my skincare routine, and I can’t recommend it enough. If you’re looking for intense hydration and a glowing complexion, this is the one!"
"This has become my new favorite routine each morning!  Im on mask #3 and my skin is smoother, moisturized and visibly better!  I am now obsessed with any Korean product!  This is by far the easiest way to quickly repair damaged texture, minimize wrinkles and best wake up routine over coffee. 10-20 min very effective"
"I really like this.I love taking care of my skin due to how hydrated it has become and how soft after using this. It’s very effective.It is extremely easy to apply. You do NOT have to wear this to sleep which most people and influencers do but you do not. However I do lol.I don’t believe there is a smell. Maybe I just can’t tell? So even if there is one, it is not strong.Definitely worth your money. Especially if you LOVE skincare and taking care of your skin."
Skin feels very hydrated afterwards
Can’t believe I’m saying this I love it. My face looks so much better. I tried so many different masks.but tbh I never really liked any of them. One of my friend she tried she keep telling me to buy. So I ordered it and tried my skin feels so soft and smooth I never felt that before thank you for such an amazing mask. I will buy more after I’m done with these ❤️
"I use many COSRX products because they're just amazing and these live up to the expectations as well. They're very slimy but to me, that is a good thing because it gives so much hydration and makes me glow afterwards. My friend has sensitive skin and she tried these and now they're her go-to face masks. They leave everyone's skin hydrated, soft, and glowing. You have to try these!!"
"I’ve bought these masks multiple times and ever since I’ve used it I haven’t used another mask. I have very sensitive skin, but it doesn’t irritate my skin at all. It leaves skin hydrated, refreshed, and bright. I think it’s very effective and worth the price."
These face mask are the truth! They make your face feel so good as if you went to get a facial. Of course please cleanse your face before use. The hydration and moisture is great!  It gives you a nice glow! You won’t be disappointment!
I absolutely love the quality of this product! It worked so well for my pores.
"Perfect skin, very nice smells and great feeling"
Gentle on my sensitive skin. Got multiple uses out of each tube with almost full face coverage. The peel is super satisfying. Only complaint is it takes MUCH longer to dry enough to peel than stated on package. Leaving all 3 for a long time did not irritate my skin though.
My granddaughters loved them. They had fun with the different textures and colors. The applicators made it easy to put on without getting it all over your hands.
"The products are very small, basically travel size. It’s a good set of products, but am disappointed that they’re so small. The quality is good, I love that it came with a face brush to apply the product. Would not purchase again, though."
I used one but it’s ok
Bought these for a girls' night party.  I've tried two of the three scents.  They are good and make my skin feel nice.
"I have the Turmeric clay mask on for this picture which helps with brightening, repairing, & anti-aging along with an under eye patch for anti wrinkles, & lastly a lip plumping mask... honestly I am blessed with not too many nor too deep of wrinkles so this is more of a luxury item for myself to use. I'm trying to get more into skin care or self care and these 3 products are on the smaller side than I was expecting (see second picture comparison with a regular size contract lense case & toe clippers) but u don't use much when using these products. The silicone applicator is nice and small enough to place the product where you need it without it being a mess. The product itself is soft and dries fast."
"Pensé que el artículo traería más contenido, pero la verdad cada mascarilla contiene muy poco. Para probar está muy bien, y la espátula sirve bastante, pero el costo está un poco elevado para el producto, y la verdad es que las mascarillas tampoco tienen un efecto tan fuerte."
"This product goes on and dried quickly. Easy removal, no skin irritation, great value for the money and very durable."
Love the scent of the face mask. I love the way it feels on your face. Nice relaxing feel. You can feel it tightening . afterwards your skin feels nice and clean and refreshed.worth the price.it reminds me of the face mask when I bought from Avon many moons ago. I plan on buying again.I feel it does a nice job.love the cooling effect.
"Smelled nice and my skin felt afterwards like I'd used a nice lotion. It dried and peeled off nicely.Didn't seem to remove a lot of dead skin or anything from the pores, so I was hoping for a bit more of that."
I’ve been using this product for about a month now and I love it! I use it about every 3 days and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth. It’s easy to apply and doesn’t have a strong scent. Drying time doesn’t take too long and it always peels off clean. I will definitely purchase again.
Hard to get off after washing face
"Same product, I use to get."
Kind of sticky. Drys slow. I used a hairdryer on cool to finish the drying. Never got that pulling feel to know it's dry. Ok for the price.
"Freeman Cucumber Facial Mask is all I hoped it would be. Yes the smell is cucumber but it is not a strong scent. It easily comes out of the tube. It’s somewhat thick coming out but it a nice smooth on. It’s easy to apply. Upon having a freshly washed face I apply it all over my face including my neck. I try my best to avoid my eye brows as my 1st application I wasn’t as careful & a mask doesn’t peel of hair! I let it dry for 20 minutes. In reaching for one portion of it, it literally comes off my entire face in one piece! I’ve never experienced such a mask. My face feels so smooth & has a brightness to it. I wash any left residue with warm water & I’m set to apply my usual morning or nightly facial regime. This is definite quality for the price I paid & I recommend it. I didn’t disappoint me & I hope my experience helps you in deciding to purchase it or not, I say do so. Oh, I have oily skin, non sensitive skin & it keeps my oil at bay every time I use it."
"No es difícil de quitar, se adhiere lo necesario para quitar impurezas y no afectar la piel.La piel queda muy linda, la recomendaría usar 2 veces por semana."
"Smells ok, quite light. First time I used it I don't think I put the right amount on because only certain bits peeled and the rest had to be washed off.... BUT the 2nd time I added more to my skin and I achieved THE SATISFACTION of peeling off in one go (almost) . Works well. Skins feels lovely and soft afterwards. Will buy again"
Excellent product face feels refreshed after use
un masque qui repose et fait du bien
"He probado productos similares, y este es muy muy espeso. Aún así, lo volveré a comprar."
I love these face masks and they're very reasonably priced. You'll feel a tingle but its just the masks exfoliating. My favorite is the tea tree mask it really calmed my acne down for the week. The vitality one is my second favorite because my pores were snatched. I definitely recommend them and plan on getting more this week!!
"Great product , ordered these for my daughter and she loved them! Great value for your money, effective on skin , leaves skin feeling clean and refreshed, smell amazing, very comfortable & great for gifting"
My sister loved these and they are easy to use
"Some of these felt really sticky and left a weird residue on my skin. I followed the instructions with each mask. There were a few that I liked, however! Good way to find a favorite mask."
"I love the bright colors of these packets. I buy them to add to gift baskets or gift bags for my friends and co-workers. I think the sayings and the patterns are interesting and make them seem more expensive or upscale. My only complaint, and it is a small one, is they dont have as many for men, i think anymore, men like to do some self care and enjoy a face mask, even if they don't always share it with everyone. But these are a good size, they work great and are reasonably priced.  For these reasons I give these Facial Masks 5 stars"
These face masks have become apart of my weekly routines and they’re amazing !!
"I love these adorable masks! I got them as a treat for myself, and I don't regret it. Not only is the packaging art super cute but they leave my skin nice a smooth."
"Loved the masks, my face felt super hydrated and soft."
"I've been using these masks for about a year, and I LOVE them. They're so cheap, but they work well. If you've never tried sheet masks before or are trying to find a cheap option so you can do them more often, these are a great option. They DO contain fragrance, but it's pretty much last on the ingredients list, and they've never irritated my skin and my skin is pretty sensitive and I have mild rosacea. I find the scent to be pleasant; each one has a slightly different scent. They are also very well hydrated but don't drip everywhere and are SO easy to unfold. I've noticed there is always a bit of extra essence to squeeze out of the bag afterwards. I personally love that--after the initial essence has soaked in, I just pat in the excess essence!I've noticed when I use these sheet masks regularly (at least once a week--ideally more often), my pores on my T-zone and cheeks are smaller. So I think them looking big might be a sign my skin is dehydrated (dehydrated skin is both dry and overproduces oil.) These masks also make my skin glow and look less red. My skin gets SO red like a tomato if I exercise or go out in the heat, and these sheet masks (or any tbh lol) calm down my skin immediately instead of it taking forever to calm down. For the past month, I've been using one sheet mask a night and alternating between these, the $2 Missha ones, and some cheap Etude House ones, and my skin has never looked better! :) I do them in the evening and my skin still looks good when I wake up!"
"Really nice make at a great price and are VERY Hydrating!  I actually put one on before bed and slept as long as I could on my back and took off the mask sometime in the middle of the night when it was 'dry' and woke up to PLUMP, SMOOTH Skin!  I LOVE THESE MASKS and will use at least twice a week, the price point is incredible!  Now I just have to figure out how to use the excess serum, maybe on my chest and arms I guess.AND equally important NO ANIMAL TESTING :)"
"I bought these for my sister in law's Christmas gift. She let me know in July that she only has 5 left, so I guess she likes them! She also has really good skin, so idk how much they help, but they definitely don't hurt. I usually trust Korean skincare, so that tracks.There are a ton of them for not too much $. Worth the purchase."
"It's pretty great once you put it in the fridge and place it on your face after running on a summer day. Your face instantly cools and the red puffiness goes away. One thing I noticed was the scent. Some are pleasant but others are a bit strange smelling. I know it's a variety pack but not all of them are great. However, great price for the that many masks."
"Great variety pack. Pleasant smell, easy to use. Not greasy and leaves skin feeling moisturized."
"I had been eye balling this for years and finally took the plunge as I recently got into face masks and how amazing it can be.I was skeptical because of how cheap it is but it had great reviews and I’m glad I finally tried. Wished I tried sooner! It’s not as moisturizing as other more expensive ones but it does make my face plump, dewy, and refreshed looking which I love because my skin tends to get dull. It also does not irritate or breakout my hormonal acne prone/oily/enlarged pored skin either. Yessss!!Since it is cheap, I use it every other day. On weekdays I use it at night but on weekends, I use it 30mins-1hr before I put my war paint on. However because my face looks refreshed, I no longer really put foundation on and my skin looks dewy for the next few hours.Decent alternative to what I currently use which is Shiseido Vital Uplifting eye mask. Its an eye mask but I dab that all over my face after to reap the benefits. Great stuff as Shiseido is known for not using harsh chemicals but that one gets pricey ($85 for 12 packs) sooo I will have to stick to this for now. I’m already on my 2nd purchase of this so I would definitely recommend..as long as your expectations are not too high lol"
"Buy this.  Just do yourself a favor and BUY THIS.  Let me start off by saying I have DRY skin on my face.  So dry.  Like shedding lizard skin dry.  I use a mask each night and,  yes, I do leave it on for longer than the recommended time (about 45 minutes for me).  In the morning, my skin is glowing, smooth, soft and moisturized.  Makeup looks phenomenal now and at such an amazing price, it's so easy to pamper yourself every night.All of these are different masks so I randomly pick one out of the pile each night and see how it goes.  So far, none have caused burning or breakouts.  All is more than well on my face.  Each mask is absolutely drenched in essence.  I use the excess at the bottom of the pack to rub on my chest area.  Don't expect it to smell like strawberry lip smackers, but the scent isn't bad, per se. What's important is how bomb this will make your skin look and feel.I'm making this my permanent nightly routine.  Love this company for providing high quality at an affordable price."
"Huge value, great product!!!"
I really like these masks. I have very dry skin and use them almost every day. they help to moisturize and refresh my face.
I ordered 26 and they came but they are not of all flavours mostly contained rose and pomogranate . But the sheet masks are good and hydrating and also refreshing.
"These are great! Buying Korean skincare online can be risky due to fakes etc but I’d purchased this brand before and had some faith. Seller has very good reviews so I took the plunge on this larger pack and was pleasantly surprised. All 39 arrived well packaged and in great condition (I just grabbed a handful to show for the photo!). You get a really nice range of different masks. They all have an expiration date clearly printed on the bottom and this batch came with a great expiration of 2022. The packaging design isn’t as pretty as some brands but don’t let that fool you into thinking these aren’t good!Each mask has its own qualities based on the ingredients and these are listed on the front. My favourite for my oily, acne prone skin is the seaweed mask, but there are none that I actually dislike. None of these masks irritate my acne and they have a pleasant but mild scent. The masks are big so will fit a range of faces, you just need to do a little adjustment to get it to fit a smaller face. I have to re-fold it around my chin a few times but that’s fine. I find that the upper lip area dries out fastest for me, perhaps because it’s a thin strip, but when I readjust the chin area I then pat the upper lip to deposit any spare serum there. The key is to not let the mask dry out on your face.These masks are thick and not easily torn if you’re new to unfolding them. They are also soaked in serum which is really good. After you’re done I recommend squeezing the serum out. I pat a little extra into my face and the rest into my neck, collar and chest area. The serum in these masks isn’t really designed to be stored long term out of the packet so I don’t suggest wringing it out and keeping it in a bottle etc. It may expire quickly even if stored in the fridge.I use these once a week in the evening, in place of my usual serum, so the mask gets applied after toner and essence, followed by moisturiser. I like to gently pat my face periodically to ensure it’s being absorbed and remove the mask after 20 minutes while it’s still wet. Then I wring it out etc.These are a really cost effective way of introducing sheet masks into your routine. It’s a great weekly treat to look forward to and I enjoy seeing which one I pull out of the pile each week. Further, they make great little extras in gifts - I picked a few cute fruity ones out of the pile as stocking stuffers this Christmas.Overall I think these masks are great for both beginners and more experienced skincare enthusiasts alike. Don’t let the low price or less flowery cutesy packaging fool you - these are really good!"
"La majorité des Facial Mask Sheet sont fait avec des produits provenant de plantes qui sont très tentant pour un moment de soin cocooing. Mon premier masque le White 07 est une bombe dans sa compo ma peau apprécie.A noter que quelques masques sortent du lot pour le meilleur comme pour le pire comme ceux la à Vitamine C, au Charbon, à l'Or, à la Perle, à l' Acide hyaluronique,...  ou encore des masques moins appréciables à base de produits provenant des animaux : serpent ou chevaux qui ne me semble pas nécessaire. Pour le prix ça le vaut c'est un super cadeau à ce faire."
"Premetto che non ho ancora usato tutte le 39 maschere, però quelle utilizzate le ho amate!!! Sono idratanti, ben imbevute, molto fresche, tutte diverse. Ottimo prodotto. Ho controllato la scadenza di ogni maschera e tutte scadono tra il 2021 e il 2022. Consigliatissimo soprattutto per il rapporto qualità/prezzo."
"It cleans really good my face, amazing product"
"I have been using Dermacontrol face mask since 2019, right around the start of the pandemic, so I'm an old pro at this. I am 56, have combination skin (but more oily in the warmer months) and have tried my share of other face masks. Ever since I discovered this one, it's my ONLY go-to because it does what it says it does, it's affordable and Cetaphil really is a leader in skincare.I've seen some images in other reviews where all you see is white. Like the mask is way thicker than it needs to be. So let me tell you how I use it and if you try it, you'll find the results are just the same and you use far less product. One jar lasts me almost 4 months, and that's with regular use.PUT IT ON LIKE LOTION. Let me say that again for the people in the back.📣 Put it on like lotion.Use the little spatula and take out just a little bit, like half of the tip of the little spatula. Spread that onto one cheek, then MASSAGE IT IN LIKE LOTION. As the instructions say, you want just a thin layer. Having a heap of it just sitting on top of your skin isn't more effective. By rubbing it in like lotion, it really gets into the pores.Now, do the same for the other cheek and then the forehead and chin. Of course, don't forget to go over your nose and upper lip. Let sit and then rinse.That's it. You'll be saving money and wasting less.You'll see in my photo that it as it dries, my skin is barely white. Because I'm massaging it over my face, it's getting into my pores to do the dirty work so there's less product just gunked up on my face. When I rinse, my skin is baby soft and ready for serum and moisturizer.Also, sidebar, *the spatula isn't meant to be used to SPREAD the product*. It's only to keep the mask sanitary and keep you from having to scoop it out with your fingers, getting it all under your nails. What a waste of product if not for the spatula. You use it to scoop out the product then swipe it off onto your face. Then rinse it off and put it away.I really hope this helps you get the most out of this most wonderful product. When used this way, you only need to purchase about 3 or 4 jars per year. I use it more in the summer months when I'm more oily but that's still a good deal.Go forth and be pretty!"
"While it definitely sapped all of the oil and impurities, it stung a little while using it and afterwards. Pore size was visibly reduced, too, which is a big pro. Still, if you have sensitive skin, you might still find this a bit too stripping and even slightly painful."
"What is this sorcery? It's been a little while since I purchased this simply because I forgot how great it is. I get cystic acne on occasion and glycolic peels and retinol had been keeping my skin perfect until about a month ago. First my forehead was covered in little acne bumps and I tried some of the traditional acne treatments and the little bumps went away but the cystic acne came back in full force. After no success with masks designed for acne I came back to this. My skin texture improved after the first use and now after using it 3 times within a week or so my cystic acne is reducing dramatically. I don't know what it is about this product, but it is so gentle, scent free and really instantly gives you a glow. I'll leave it on for 15-20 minutes if I have the time and my skin never gets dried out. If you want to generally clarify your skin, this is the product for you. The price is great and the results are both gentle and immediate."
"I'm in my 40's now, when great skin doesn't just 'happen' but needs to be worked on. I already have a pretty solid skincare routine but I thought I'd add a mask once a week to compensate for any 'weak spots' in my routine.I don't have 'sensitive' skin, but just like anyone else, I do find some products to be irritating, especially some of the heavily-scented ones. This mask is not scented, therefore it is non-irritating (for me).This mask applies easily. I globbed it on pretty thick the first time and still wasn't sure that I was using enough product because I didn't feel any tingling or any other indication that it was working. After 15 minutes, I rinsed it off, feeling like I had wasted my money. It did rinse off easily, I only had to use a washcloth around my forehead and jawline. BUT THEN - my skin was as soft as a baby's behind, and this was BEFORE applying my usual serum or moisturizer. I could not stop touching my face, it was so soft!This also cleared up a few 'aggravated' blemishes along my jawline - the type of blemishes that seem to fester under the surface of the skin but never quite come to a head. Gone! Completely gone!I will be using this mask one a week, either until I die or until they stop making it."
Para piel grasa con tendencia a la acne deja muy limpio y mejora la apariencia de imperfecciones si es para piel sensible y no tiene olor muy recomendable
"I like it more than you're normal mix it yourself bentonite aztec powder. It doesn't leave your skin dry.However, it looks small in amount once received but remember it's only supposed to be like 85g or something, so it's not supposed to be a lot anyway. It's still worth it just the tub doesn't look full."
"Produkt ist angenehm. Verpackung deutet an, dass Produkt viel größer ist als es tatsächlich ist. Spatel ist völlige Plastikverschwendung. Null Mehrwert, Mensch kann einfach seine Hände nutzen. Kaufen nächstes Mal andere Marke, wegen der genannten Gründe."
"Really soaks up the oil on your skin. If you suffer with oily skin, this is a god send. I only had to use this once a month because it lasted so long with the oil on my skin that I was really surprised at how well this worked. Amazing"
Good to ise
"I got these masks as a prime day deal and honestly could not be happier. You get 3 masks all worth the price. They make you skin so soft and clean after you apply them onto your skin. It takes about 20 minutes to dry and all you need is a small amount. It’s super easy to apply. They all smell great and for the price, you get enough to last you a while! They are the perfect size to travel with. I will definitely continue to use these :)"
This trio of face packs is perfect to cool down your face and remove tanning and dead skin. The fragrance of each one is amazing. The application is easy and spreads well. Dries off in time and leaves the skin feeling soft and supple.
these are nice masks but they don't seem to actually help my skin. They're lovely to relax in the bath with but as far as looking for something to help acne prone skin (like i was) I wouldn't waste the money. But if you're looking for something to just play around with when friends come over I would recommend this for you (;
Looks as shown in the picture. The colors were bright and pretty .... It actually came with an applicator which is nice. The product did cause a bit of tingling and I did not notice any improvement in my skin. I give this 3 stars.
These are nice masks. I’ve only used the gray and pink so far and liked them both can’t wait to try to green.
"I loved the bubble mask, it cleans your face wonderfully. The thicker the layer, the more bubbles you get.The other masks when first put on felt ok, but then after the first three minutes or so, they started to burn.  At first I left it on for about two minutes, but then decided to take it off. After I washed it off, my skin had a rash on it for a few hours, and my skin was still burning. I don't normally have sensitive skin, but these masks seemed to irritate it."
"Ordered this trio for the bubble mask but really like all three of them. Put the mask on, wait fifteen minutes and wash it off. All there is to it. Bubble mask tingles  and is just fun. Other two masks really work too. Perfect size to take with you when you travel for a little facisl “pick me up”."
"All of these masks burned the crap out of my skin!!! I have normal to sensitive skin and I love clay masks. They always work well with my skin type. These masks on the other hand left my entire face in a terrible itchy burning (like acid was poured on my face) rash. I don't recommend this brand of ""clay"" mask for any skin type."
"Love the container, it's recyclable. I put my jar in the fridge to add some cold therapy to my face. Left it on for 15 min set a timer so you don't forget. My face has been so smooth, bright and beautiful I'm very happy and will buy again when I need more. My face gets added moisture and thus brand is crutelty free. Great price point too!"
"This product is not only gentle, hydrating, and easily-applicable, but it also smells fantastic! There's a lightly noticeable scent of enchanting marshmallows. Be careful not to eat it! The consistency allows you to easily put it on and take it off, and isn't over-drying while setting on your skin. Its texture can best be compared to fluffy whipped cream.I'm currently on Accutane, which dries out my skin, meaning I have to be exceptionally careful with products I use. This mask was was non-irritating. It left my skin feeling firmer, with a soft touch. It is very gentle and doesn't leave you feeling stripped of moisture. You truly do feel like you're receiving a spa service.Overall, a fantastic product for the price you're paying. I plan on purchasing more after my container is used."
"I was actually surprise to see this actually worked because I saw this on Instagram and usually those things don't always work when they come in the mail. It smells amazing, is super light and airy on the face. It brightened my face and removed a ton of my blackheads. Overall, I would buy this product again. I am pleasantly surprised!"
"This is my go to gentle mask. For nights my face needs an extra pick me up but can't handle a more drying clay mask. It really does feel like a whipped cloud going on. Doesn't dry as flakey as a clay mask. And once it's rinsed off it makes your skin feel baby soft. I accidentally fell asleep in it a few nights ago (don't do this, if you ever have it's one of those IYKYK things)... I had a moment of panic thinking i messed up my skin, but it still rinsed off easily and I didn't have any dryness or redness. So it's very gentle and really forgiving. The marshmallow sweetness is really subtle and I'd say leans closer to unscented than most masks. It's a cute gift or something you could get for yourself thats going to last awhile. Highly recommend."

I have a photo of the products I use on rotation NOWWW. I use the mask only at night. Even my coworkers have mentioned how clear my skin looks. I made a video before using the products and after but Amazon only lets you upload one video per review so I just took screenshots from the second video.The video is before I started using the bliss cleanser and mask. I ordered them at the same time so I used them at the same time. The photos are from a day later.My bumps are a whole lot smaller. My skin literally looks brighter and smoother.- ProblemI deal with lots of cash at work hence the crazy breakout I had going on that night. I try not to touch my as much as possible cause I break out and my break outs lead to horrendous dark spots on my face.- Pink cleanserThe pink cleanser omg I works so well at removing oil and dead skin off my face. I use it in sections just to get a better clean.-Watermelon maskThe mask is so lightweight. A little goes a long way. The size is perfect for 3to5 months of usage. And it smells so good and leaves my skin feeling so soft in the morning. I do have a few of bliss serums.-Collagen padsThese are a must. I used the teatree one for weeks I absolutely hated so I switched to this one omg it’s so much better. Leaves my skin glowing and soft.-What I’m working towardsI’m trying to find a good product for my dark spots and hyperpigmentation. I feel like they’re like the hardest thing to get rid of."
"my skin is super sensitive and dry so take this with a grain of salt, but it kind of burned when i applied it? the burning went away after a few minutes but my skin was just tight and irritated after. also smells a little weird to me but other people seem to like it. cute if ur skin isn’t sensitive for a girls night but for actual repair it just didn’t work for my specific skin and that’s okay :) i’ll let my friends use it when they come over."
"So first off, this might sound silly but I was so happy to see that while the container is small, it is full to the bottom! This isn't one of those products where the bottle looks once size but half of it is empty and only a small portion is in it. The whole thing is full to the very, actual bottom. So that's a nice surprise lol. The product smells amazing and feels so soft and refreshing going on. Once or twice a week I put it on in the bath and read a book for 15 minutes before rinsing it off. My skin does feel like it's got a lil extra something for a couple days after. I'd recommend!"
"Soft, lightly scented product that's easy to apply. Washes off with little effort and leaves your skin clean, soft, and well hydrated."
"I was really looking forward to this, but was harshly disappointed when I opened it and discovered the tub was almost empty. In addition, on the bottom of the box it clearly indicates that the best before date was the date it arrived - Oct. 2, 2024. Selling things that are past their best before date without warning of that in the product info is a sketchy business practice! Make it clear so the purchaser can decide if they’re ok with that.As for the almost empty jar, there’s no situation where selling something that is missing most of the actual product is acceptable."
I love this mask. Get so many compliments on my face.

"I pop one of these highly affordable little luxuries on my face each time I've had a shower. The 20 minutes it recommends slows me down, and forces me to have that precious, but rare time to myself. That's no different to any other mask, but what is different is how my face appears afterwards. There's a nice glow and it feels and looks hydrated. They're a little fiddly to open up, but those extra few seconds adds to the ""to me love me"" time you deserve. I continue to be impressed with the quality, and have been using these for nearly two years."
I use a few brands of face mask and I like these. A little too small for some but it's still effective especially with the extra serum you get from the pouches if you squeeze it out. I put them in the fridge for times I need the cooling relief from skin irritations.  My skin feels nice and soft after. I use them as a daily facial routine.
I’ve had these for almost a year now cause they come with so much! They make my skin feel super healthy and are at a super affordable price!
"My wife got them for her and she loves them. She has sensitive skin and she hasn't have any bad reaction so far, (she's been using them since December 2023). They're fresh and the scent is good!"
Was requested and well received.
Got for me and 8yo. But they just feel icky out of the package. Hard to unfold. We’ve never used this kind of sheet mask so maybe this is normal? Hence 3 stars.
I hope these are good and refreshing. The packaging is cute!
"I love how many come in each order. Each mask I've tried makes my skin feel very clean and clear. Additionally, the liquid is plentiful and hydrates skin very well. My personal favorite is the Acai Berry mask as it is natural and smells amazing!"
"I've bought these several times now. I love these! Smells great, quality A+, easy to use."
"I've used a couple of the face masks and they are easy to unfold and place on my face, feel fantastic while on, and leave my skin feeling plump and refreshed.  This pack of 12 is a great value."
"Each mask is infused with a generous amount of essence, leaving the skin feeling hydrated and refreshed after use. The masks are easy to apply, fitting comfortably on the face, and they deliver noticeable results with regular use. The variety in this set is a highlight, allowing you to customize your skincare routine based on your skin's condition or the season."
I picked these up for my bridesmaids and I to use during my bridal shower and we absolutely loved them! The honey one made my skin feel so soft and moisturized I could hardly believe it. Will definitely be buying again!
10 out of 10
They worked well
These masks are great! My wife loves them
I couldn't use them due to how much perfume is on them. They stink.
"I haven’t used a face mask in years. I’m 55 y are old. The mask, It was easy to apply, feels nice and cool because I placed the box in the refrigerator. Once the mask is on it stays in place. My skin feels so soft smooth and hydrated!  I purchased for my young adult daughter too and will buy again!"
"I been using Maree facial masks for maybe two years now and I'm very happy every time I use this product! The ingredients are high quality and I appreciate the extra serum in each pouch because after applying the masque to my face I always use the extra serum on my neck & décolletage! Love the results! The masque leaves my skin moisturized, firm & glowing. I'm a customer for life!"
"Yea, they don’t replace good skincare habits, but they’re still awesome. The serum is thick enough that it’s not running down your face, and I can really see the difference after wearing one every single time. It glows. They’re super easy to apply, not offensive or chemical smelling, and my skin is always happy after I’ve used one. My skin is happy, and so am I. Holy cow.PS: When even guys notice in dark bar lighting, you know they’re doing some magic. Just saying."
"I received the product yesterday and applied the mask to my ""clean"" face for an overnight test. I cleaned my face with a baking soda & castor oil paste. After thoroughly rinsing the cleanser from my face, I wrestled the mask from the package. It took me 3-4 minutes to unravel the folds. I am 75 and want to look my best no matter what age. I started by sleeping on my back initially as I was worried since the mask was really wet and I thought it would be taking care of the wrinkles on my pillow case by morning.  Within about an hour the mask was pretty dry and definitely stuck to my face, meaning it wasn't going anywhere. When I woke up I ceremoniously removed the mask in front of a 10X mirror, the deeper lines around my mouth area seemed to be minimized. But a few hours later they were somewhat back, still better than before. I plan on using MAREE Facial Masks every 3 days, as an experiment, until all 6 are gone. I will use them overnight since I know they will stick to my face. I will update this review at that time."
"This worked on my ultra dry skin.  Of course it's not ""magic"", but it really softened out the fine lines.  As, others have said before me...there is enough liquid left to squeeze into a smaller container (I used a 1/2 oz one that came with a travel kit)  I dab a little on my face every morning until it's time to use a new mask. Pleased with purchase."
Theses masks are amazing! They fir perfectly and are heavily saturated with unscented serum that makes your skin feel supple and smooth!
They are good and moisturize face  but don’t expect a miracles.
"I recently had the pleasure of trying out MAREE Facial Masks with Marine Collagen & Hyaluronic Acid, and I must say, the results were nothing short of amazing! As a skincare enthusiast always on the lookout for effective products, these sheet moisturizing masks exceeded my expectations in every way.First and foremost, the ingredients list speaks for itself. The combination of Marine Collagen and Hyaluronic Acid is a skincare dream come true. Marine Collagen works wonders in rejuvenating and firming the skin, while Hyaluronic Acid provides that much-needed hydration for a radiant complexion. It's a powerhouse duo that delivers visible results.The application process was a breeze. The masks are generously saturated with the nourishing serum, and they adhere snugly to the contours of the face. I appreciated the thoughtful design that ensured a comfortable fit, allowing me to go about my routine while treating my skin to a spa-like experience.The immediate sensation upon application was refreshing, and I could feel the mask working its magic. After just one use, my skin felt noticeably smoother, plumper, and incredibly hydrated. The fine lines around my eyes and mouth seemed to diminish, leaving behind a youthful glow. I couldn't help but admire the mirror, as my complexion appeared revitalized and more radiant than ever.What sets MAREE Facial Masks apart is not only the quality of the product but also the attention to detail. The packaging is elegant and practical, making it convenient for both storage and travel. I also appreciate that these masks are free from harsh chemicals and cruelty-free, aligning with my values for ethical skincare.In conclusion, MAREE Facial Masks with Marine Collagen & Hyaluronic Acid have become a staple in my skincare routine. They offer a luxurious and effective way to pamper your skin, and the results are truly remarkable. If you're looking to elevate your skincare game and achieve a radiant complexion, don't hesitate to indulge in the goodness of MAREE Facial Masks. Your skin will thank you!"
Super hydrating and my skin is crazy soft after. I keep them in the fridge for a refreshing and relaxing treat to my skin every so often.
"This leaves my skin feeling refreshed after I finish. I love the glow afterwards, as it looks as if I just left the spa after spending a pretty penny on a facial. The price of this is great, and you cannot beat an at home facial that provides such great results."
This is a great product have been using it for 6 months and it just great. Highly recomment it for that moisture we need.
"Usually these things irritate my skin, but after 30 min my skin looked less red. Pores smaller. Smoother. I am 43 with combo skin. No fillers or Botox and this made my skin really soft."
Mask was hydrating. I would say it lasts for a few hours. I don’t feel it deeply hydrates.For the price it’s worth it.
Use these weekly they are the best ones on the market.
These are as easy to use as it seems. Tear open the packaging slide the mask off and put it on your face. Extremely cooling and hydrating. You can definitely feel the plumpness of your skin after using it. Super refreshing! I have already ordered several more.
These masks are terrific! They moisturize your skin and add softness without any harshness. They are also very affordable
"Have tried other masks, but this one is really amazingly great! Put in AM for 30 min and left my face very soft, glowing under my  make up .Very happy and satisfied 😁Loved it and referred to my sister to try , you wouldn’t regret buying this product . I just ordered more 😁"
"These masks are easy to use, not messy or greasy and leaves your skin soft and radiant. My skin was hydrated for days, great value for the money."
"Pricey but atleast you get a few. For 17 bucks for 5 that's roughly $3.40 per mask. Forget the price, I've tried several masks and only 3 worked really well for me.1. SoonJung Brand2. Whamisa Organic3. Organic EarthCount this one as top 4 now.I have normal skin, not sensitive and have a good lifestyle, no drinking etc.But I've tried several sheet masks and they all have had some issue one way or another.I'm super sensitive about what ingredients I put on my face and although I'm not 100% cleared on this face mask (lapcos) I give it a safe thumbs up.It works well. Soothes the skin and brightened my complexion back to it's normal state. Broke me out once or twice after using with other products but once my skin got used to it, it was smooth sailing. I only use sheet masks when I really need them or need a pamper session. Pearl is my favorite because it really does add a slight glowing effect. Face feels great after using it, even though most of it is in our heads!"
The mask feels great! Skin looked glossier after but not for very long.
"I can tell the difference after using these - even the first time. I'm in my 50's and I don't have terrible skin, but I do have wrinkles by my mouth now and it was really bad when I was coming off of a cold - I used one of these and it put the moisture back into my face and reduced the appearance of those wrinkles!  I was pleased with the results."
"I loved these masks, they aren’t a miracle, but they make your skin real nice the next day."
"These mask were fine! Not bad, not great. They are super super moist when you take them out of the package but the mask material is cheap & feels kind of soggy on your face. It does do a great job of hydrating your face!"
"I got these facemasks because I'm looking to upgrade my skincare routine big time. These masks are sooooo good! I was a little wary about the whole ""honey"" thing but they aren't sticky like that at all (just in the traditional face mask slimy type of way). The mask itself is super light and the serum inside is so moisturizing. After I put on the mask I still had a lot of serum left over so i just put the rest of it back on my face. Honestly, there's a lot left over but that's a good thing in my book because I can just use the rest of it on my face after the mask has dried out (kinda like a second mask). There's basically no fragrance and my skin felt so good after using it that I immediately bought more. These masks are definitely worth the price ;))"
wife really likes them
"I'm absolutely obsessed with this sheet mask! It's like a spa treatment right at home. I've been using them for a year now after a friend got them to me as a gift. I always have at least 5 options in my beauty drawer as they have many options to select from.  I tried many sheet masks nothing comes close to the result this one gives me. Every time I use it, I get compliments on my skin.  I highly recommend they are a bit costly, but they are worth it, trust me."
I love this facemask. Will definitely buy again.
"Tengo el cutis algo maltratado y me la pongo en la noche y al día siguiente mi piel amanece rejuvenecida.  La baba de caracol es regenerante  , ayuda con las manchas y al cutis maduro.  La recomiendo bastante"
"Hidratación facial, suavidad, descanso. Pruébalas."
"First let me say if you’re a mask-every-night person, these are for you. Thirty masks for $19 is a great value, especially considering these masks are excellent quality. My skin is dry but I also suffer from hormonal acne so I’m always looking for products that will moisturize but not feel heavy or exacerbate any existing blemishes. These masks are excellent! My face just soaks up the moisture and I don’t feel sticky afterwards. I can tell immediately that any acne flares are considerably less red and swollen, even after I get a little aggressive with the extractor tool. The tweezers are a nice touch to avoid getting germs in the pack. The smell is really soothing and clean; not overpowering or artificial. There’s plenty of serum on the masks without feeling drippy or sloppy, and they stay moist on your face for a long time. Plus they’re comfortable and don’t feel like they’re smothering you like some thicker masks can; they stay in place without sliding around. A definite repurchase! I’ve recommended them to all my product junkie friends!"
"This cica sheet mask is a must have for me! I have combination skin and am highly sensitive to most skin products. I heard about the cica complex a while ago on one of those Asian beauty YouTube channels and was intrigued: something soothing, calming and hydrating that will heal my skin barrier over time? Sounded too good. I started with the Dr. Jart+ Cicapair and I fell in love. Eventually, I wanted something that I could quickly rely on for those mornings when I don't have the energy or time to do a full day-time skincare routine and decided on these sheet masks - WOW. Just wow! They're worth every penny. They're convenient. They're effective. The tweezers/applicator that come with the box are a nice touch and makes application really effortless. They do have a light herbal scent to them in case you're wondering? 5 well deserved stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟To others I say: please don't give this awesome product a negative review just because you had a reaction... Always, always, always test-patch and don't blame it on the products. Read the ingredients. Take informed decisions. And be patient to your skin when introducing a new product to it."
"I used this several times and liked the feeling. However, I am a beekeeper. Honey bees can act defensive with they detect certain scents, like bananas. This product has a distinctive scent and I can't determine what it is. After using a mask in the morning, I went outside in the evening and was stung by one of my bees near the eye. I was no where near the hives and was puzzled what provoked a sting to the face. I believe it was the lingering scent of the mask. Checking the ingredients listed, I am sure that was the cause. The ingredients include propolis extract and royal jelly extract. The scent of the anise might be what is strong. I will give the remainder of my masks to someone that doesn't keep bees."
"I am in love with these masks. They smell great and are so hydrating without any stickiness. I also love the packaging - I've always hated the waste of individually packaged masks so finding these was a big relief. Yes, they are not as soaked in serum as individually wrapped masks and do dry out if you're someone who likes to keep your mask on for longer than 20 minutes. I just bought a reusable silicone face mask to put on top and it stays hydrated for as long as I want.The packaging is also super cute - that's why I keep mine out on the counter :D"
"So I was recently put on trentinoin to which I had a bad reaction. It felt like my skin was burned off, I had this peeling, itchy, burning sensation constantly. Any product I put on my face made it burn more, sunscreen, moisturizer. I couldn’t do it. On the 4th day of waiting for my skin to chill out I decided to use this mask.It felt so good.Instant relief and when I took the mask off? My skin was so moisturized, soft and calm. My redness disappeared and all. Only after one use! I’ve been using it for about a week and a half straight, my skin seems to really like it. I will be using this mask until they don’t sell them anymore.Everyone’s skin is different but for me this product deserves 10+ stars.(Just be aware the shelf life for this product is only a couple months, I’m not sure if every box is different)"
"I’m not a guy who likes masks, but I love these. My partner and I do little ‘treat ourselves’ evenings and slap these on after applying serums. It feels fancy and our skin is super soft afterwards."
"Not the highest in quality but, good value for the money especially, if you mask regularly. It reminded me of the packaged hand wipes at restaurants. It’s good though for a quick mask in the morning or evening especially with the Reedle Shot."
"These masks are so good for hydrating i use them on a weekly basis, especially on the days where my skin is extra dry."
"Really amazing, or give smooth skin..on plus side the product seems to be imported by the seller which is amazing"
يجنن أحطه مرتين في الأسبوع 💗
Fast shipping and legit good
以前から気になり購入しました。優しい穏やかな香りに癒されます。夜使うと翌朝、肌がしっとり、柔らかく朝のお化粧ノリが良いです。手放せなくなりました。
"I saw Jihyochan use this and i had to get it myself. It is very relaxing and soothing. I have the VT Cosmetics exfoliating pads and that clears my face up so much, I use 3x per week. So I decided I would get the mask version. Amazing, product of value, and I love this brand so much."
"Officially my favorite masks. They are moisturizing, they have good reviews on Yuka, and there’s no strong scent. There’s definitely a noticeable difference on my skin. Great for quick facial!"
"I have used each one of the masks. They feel great and the appearance of my skin looks fantastic! They work very well, I would recommend these."
"These are by far my favorite sheet masks! I love them so much, I started including them in gift baskets to friends and co-workers and they all enjoy them as much as I do. At first it may seem a little slimy as you pull it out of the pouch and it can be a little difficult to unfold because of it, but one you put it on your face, the hydration instantly rejuvenates tired skin. After taking the mask off, my face feel so hydrated and has a nice glowy look! Tip, don't wash the residue off after you take the mask off, gently massage it into your skin. Your skin will love you for it!"
"I've been waiting to write this review to see how repeated use would affect my acne and skin overall. I'm really happy with them! I purchased several orders of the lemon, charcoal, and mixed variety masks. The fragrance is light and pleasant, all feel great on my skin, and have plenty of essence to evenly cover your face and neck. Over the last couple weeks my face and neck have become much softer, more moisturized, and my acne has reduced dramatically.  The essence is just thick enough that it won't run easily, but is also very easy to apply and massage into the skin. To note: I do also use a daily face wash and moisturizer, and a charcoal mud mask or charcoal peal mask as needed (all from different brands). That said, I can clearly see the benefits from adding the sheet masks to my daily skin care routine. I use a different variety of these sheet masks based on my skins need for the day- moisture, brightness, toning, or reducing redness.When I use these masks, instead of leaving them on for the 10-15 minute recommendation, I leave them on for about 30 minutes to fully enjoy the fragrance and cooling effect the masks have. When done the instructions say to massage the essence into the skin, but I prefer to rinse my skin with cold water and pat dry to close my pores, and then apply a light moisturizer.My ONLY complaint is that the eye and mouth holes are super tiny, so you have to be extra careful applying and take extra care that the essence doesn't get in your eyes or mouth. The masks needs to be adjusted around the corners of my mouth and it lays over my eyebrows which makes me a bit nervous. I'm a 5'3"" female, with proportionate eyes and mouth, so it being a tight fit on me means it would probably be much too small for other people. It's not unusable, just a tight fit. You could also cut the holes larger, if you wanted to take the extra step.Overall high quality masks that work well even for my sensitive and dry skin!"
"I love these masks for a quick self-care moment. I use them after my outdoor runs when my face has gotten a lot of sun and I feel I need an extra bit of oomph to restore moisture. I love the variety of the masks and the packaging is beautiful. It's easy to get the mask out and on, the little cut-outs fit my face well. The mask fabric holds the serum well. Definitely my go to mask."
I use these once a week after using my facial steamer.  My own mini facial.  They are so moisturizing and great for the price!
"I was honestly hesitant about getting these since I wasn't sure how strong the scent was, and I'm prone to getting migraines from strong, floral scents. Thankfully, the scents on these masks, as varied as they are, are pretty mild and pleasant, and I haven't had an issue with them.The masks are also very moisturizing, I love how plump my skin feels afterwards when I put my face cream on. I can't say how effective they are in the different claims they have (e.g. some say calming, some say detox), since I didn't really notice a difference in the effects on my skin, but I buy sheet masks for the moisturizing effect and it didn't really bother me.Good qualify sheet masks, they are thick and easy to put on, with a generous amount of serum on the masks and in the pouch. There's definitely enough serum left in the pouch to apply to your neck, decolletage, hands, and even arms."
Skin irritation
Nice product
"I've been using the LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask for a while now, and I can confidently say it's become an essential part of my skincare routine! I use it every two nights, and the results are amazing. My face feels incredibly moist, fresh, and radiant the morning after I apply it. The best part? I don’t even feel the need to wash my face right away when I wake up—it leaves my skin so hydrated and healthy-looking that I can just go about my day without needing to do much more.One thing I love is how lightweight it feels. Despite being so hydrating, it never feels heavy or greasy on my skin. I was worried that an overnight mask might leave some sort of sticky residue or transfer to my pillow, but there’s none of that! It absorbs beautifully into my skin, and when I wake up, my pillow stays clean—such a relief. It’s nice to have a product that works hard through the night without leaving any mess behind.Another unique aspect of how I use this mask is that I skip the applicator altogether. I know many people prefer using the spatula to apply it, but for me, there's something really satisfying about using my hands to spread it over my face. I even like having a little bit of the mask left on my fingers—it’s especially soothing on my cuticles! It’s like I’m giving myself a mini hand treatment as well as a facial, so for me, using my hands is a more personal and enjoyable part of the experience.From the very first night I started using it, I noticed a difference. My skin felt noticeably softer and had this natural glow that didn’t go unnoticed—people actually complimented my skin the day after! It gave me that extra boost of confidence, and it just confirmed what a game-changer this product is.Aesthetically, the mask is also a winner. The sleek, minimal packaging looks so chic on my dresser. The clean design and subtle color palette really elevate the whole product and make it feel more luxurious. There’s something about having a beautifully packaged product that adds to the experience, and the LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask definitely does that for me.Overall, this mask has been such a positive addition to my routine. It’s simple, effective, and gives me that ""just had a facial"" look without all the extra steps or fuss. If you’re looking for an overnight treatment that delivers hydration, radiance, and a luxurious feel, I highly recommend trying the LANEIGE Water Sleeping Mask. It’s a little bit of magic that works while you sleep!"
"I brought this after listening to a podcast that raved about it, I was hesitant because most products talked online don’t work for me but this one is amazing. I have spent hundreds of dollars on an ounce of face creams over the years so when I tired this cream I was very impressed at the quality, what it did for my skin and the price point. Also the jar last forever. There is almost no smell and after a lot of research this product has no harmful ingredients which I truly appreciate. I put it on at night after washing my face and it feels light and cool and absorbs very quickly. Waking up my skin is butter soft and radiant. I am so happy with this cream and so happy to find a cream that actually works after all this time"
"This is my second bottle from this moisturizer and it’s a game changer for my nighttime skincare routine. I have combination skin, and this mask gives me the right amount of hydration without making my T-zone greasy.What I love most is how lightweight it feels. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed by morning. The scent is subtle and soothing, perfect for bedtime. I’ve noticed a significant improvement in my skin’s texture and moisture levels after just a few uses.Another great thing is that it contains ingredients like hyaluronic acid and beta-glucan, which help with hydration and soothing the skin. This is ideal for anyone looking to boost their skin’s hydration overnight without the heaviness of a traditional cream (but I must confess that I sometimes use it during the daytime too because it feels amazing and very very light on the skin).If you're looking for an easy, effective way to amp up your skincare routine, this maks is definitely worth a try."
"I can’t begin to describe how amazing this product feels on your skin! When applying it, it felt so silky smooth and light! Not heavy like your typical mask. I was hesitant at first to believe when I woke up I’d notice much of a difference but boy did I! My skin was noticeably smoother and moisturized after just one use! 10/10!"
"Good sized ""minis"". I like the blue mask more than the pink, but both make my skin feel well hyrdated. Looove the lip mask. I have sensitive skin, but have had no reactions to any of the products. Worth it if you want to try them out."
"I never write reviews, but I had to for this. I’ve been on tretinoin for the last few weeks, and my skin has been so dry making my makeup look absolutely horrible! I wanted to get a more nourishing moisturizer for at night and saw this on tiktok. I only have used this once last night, but I am stunned. I washed it off and did my morning skincare routine as usual. My makeup went on so smoothly and stayed like that the whole day. My face is so moisturized and soft. I am definitely going to keep using this, forever probably. It actually feels like a water type of consistency, too. Not sticky at all. I am just fascinated by the product as a whole."
"I never leave reviews...The pink cream is soft, almost whipped and cooling. Lip mask smells delicious and is super smoothing, feels hydrating. Haven't tried the blue one yet. So far very happy!"
"I have been searching for a face moisturizer that doesn't just melt into my eyes overnight, as I tend to sweat at night. Also, I have autism and moisturizer is something I really struggle with the feeling of.I just used the pink one and it got into my eyes a tiny bit overnight but it doesn't feel as bad as other moisturizers. And I've used the blue one a couple times and it feels absolutely lovely, and didn't irritate my eyes at all. Both masks are very lightweight, and you only need a small amount, it spreads very easily.My face feels great the morning after using both sleep masks. Personally I can't tell a difference between the two of them but both make my skin feel nice. The lip mask feels like any other heavy lip balm and I haven't really noticed a difference using it, but I'll keep using it since I have it."
"1st time buyer of this brand. Both sleeping masks are wonderful, although I'll say the fragrance for the pink mask is too strong for me. Both did not clog pores and left my face bright and firm in the morning. The lip mask leaves lips smooth and hydrated. Overall would repurchase everything but would prefer if they didn't make it so strongly scented."
Excelente hidratación al amanecer.La volvería a comprar cuando vuelva a estar en descuento en Amazon México.
I love using it at nightIn the morning my skin looks so hydrated
great product
"I loooooove everything that comes with this set. I obviously only use these at night usually in rotation, after cleansing I use this as a substitute for moisturizer.The pink glow mask really does help you wake up with glowing bouncy skin!!The blue water mask is lovely my skin feels bright when I wake up and my skin texture has truly evolved since using these products and I have been for about 2 months now and still have a bit left of both.Will most likely purchase the large size off Sephora"
So My purchase was initially for myself. But it felt so good and 4choices to suit my needs. I just couldn’t resist ordering one as a gift for my friend’s upcoming birthday. Luv It!
My face feels awake.  Smell good. Easy to apply and remove
Great value for the cost. They will last for a long time. I have tried them all and impressed with the results. Love the applicator
Cleared my skin so fast
"I bought these masks because I'm pregnant so I have some hormonal acne just on the side of my beautiful face. I also wanted to be able to put a mask on and wear it all day once it dried because I'm lazy and think it makes me look productive... and I do become more productive with it on but mostly because I can't lay down or it might rub on something lol. But It doesn't dry so for that I gave 4 stars. .. I'm going to change it to 5 right now tho because I do love them.They do smell amazing! I have EXTREMELY DRY skin, and this product has a lot of healthy oils along with clay which I really love. I looked up the ingredients and theres at least 80% good clean ingredients but I will have to check out the ingredients I didn't recognize.  (matcha, Dead Sea, and rose Ive tried so far) As soon as it goes on my face my face starts to sweat. I think it is the clay making the poors kind of shrivel in confusion of the stringent dry pull of clay and volcanic ash...but the mix of butters and oils...however I was looking for that!I think its a must for dry skin. I love that they're different colors smells and ingredients. I feel fancy as I job hunt each day. Its a real treat."
I love these and my skin feels so soft after using them. My favorite is the turmeric and rose. I will repurchase.
"So here’s the thing, I feel like these might possibly all be the same with different color and scent… they all feel the same to touch and on the skin. I don’t really notice that they do anything differently or specially and I made sure to test them all more than once before reviewing.They do feel nice and are a good feeling face mask but I’m not sure they really do much sadly."
"Makes my face soft and the tumeric one is my favorite so far,will purchase again thank you."
"Ich benutze Gesichtsmasken eigentlich gerne an meinen ""Wellnesstagen"" - diese Masken trage ich jedoch täglich auf!Ich leide seit meinem zwölften Lebensjahr an schlimmer Akne, reine Haut hatte ich seitdem noch nie... Auch mit Unterstützung von Hormonen der Pille die ich extra hierfür verwende wurde die Haut noch nie wirklich ""Normal"".Jetzt sehe ich mich wieder gerne an. Die hormonell bedingen Pickel kommen zwar alle vier Wochen ;) aber dazwischen habe ich keine großen Probeleme mehr. Das Hautbild ist schon nach den ersten Anwendungen sichtlich feiner und geglättet.Ich bin begeistert 😊 wenn die Döschen leer sind wird gleich nachbestellt - tolles Produkt!... Und der kleine schaber macht das Auftragen wirllich angenehm ohne schmutzige Finger 😉"
So far I've tried the Matcha Green Tea and Deep Sea Mud masks and both have left my skin soft and clean.The pots are a great size with plenty of product in them and the applicator makes it easy to smooth the mask on.Plus love that they are cruelty free.
"Se présente sous forme de quatre petits pots avec une spatule pour application. Je n'ai utilisé que celui au Curcuma pour le moment, qui était facile d'application, frais et sympa.Pas sûre que cela change la peau (améliore ou empire) mais c'est agréable."
For facial i used it
Sent bon
I absolutely swear by these face masks! I’ve been using this brand for almost two years and love the way it makes my skin feel! Your face feels completely hydrated and looks so refreshed after using. The mask itself has the perfect thickness and the facial cutouts line up appropriately (sometimes an issue with other masks). I feel like the mask is very effective and would highly recommend them! I also think the multi-pack is a wonderful value for the money.
"I’m going on 60 and lost lots of weight, we live in the west and it’s so dry. My face looked older than I am, nobody wants to see dry gray looking skin. My granddaughter was using one when she was here. Oh I realized I had not done a moisture mask in years.  These are awesome, feels so good. I just leave on until they have nothing left in them.  I also rub it o my neck., now my daily moisturizer isn’t blamed for not helping. Wash your face really good and let the mask sit and work. I do this in the evening about an hour or so before bed."
"When you receive these (I opted for the pack of 10 or 15), they come all together in a clear plastic wrap. It's like a bag, which I like, because you don't have to lose them and they are all together. You can just take one out. I liked these because of the price and the reviews. The instructions tell you to apply the sheet mask after you finish cleansing and toning your skin. I would recommend using a hydrating toner. The American ones dry the life out of your skin, but I recommend investing in a Korean skin toner. This has done wonders for my skin and makes it soft, moisturized, and supple! The mask comes folded so it takes a short minute to open it up. It's a thin, cloth-like material that easily sticks together. It is soaked full of the solution so you don't have to worry about it drying out. Once I put it on, it was very easy to adjust to my face shape. The only thing I can say I didn't like is that it doesn't cover your entire face. I don't know if my face is too fat or what. It doesn't go down the underside of my chin or all the way to both ears. This mask would be 1000% better if it went down to your neck as well, but that's not what they made it like and I bought it knowing this so I won't  deduct the star from them. After 15 minutes, your skin feels very refreshed! Since it doesn't cover my entire face, I tend to ball the mask up and rub the rest of the solution into my skin where the mask couldn't reach and onto my neck. I love it! Sometimes, I leave it on for longer! Plus side is that you don't need to wash this mask off! Just let the solution soak into your skin!P.S. - Sometimes I realize this mask doesn't give as much moisture as I would like. I found this only occurs when my skin is dehydrated from not drinking enough water. So up the water intake and you will see much more of a difference! Water can really make or break you in the skincare game so drink up!"
"I may give 5 stars after a longer use if it continues to work as well as it is the last 3 times used! I can see my skin a bit more full after 3 treatments … over a week and a half. My skin has been very dry, mostly instead of cobanation and I have sensitive skin and had no irritation issue …haven’t gone to get Botox for a while and many lines have set in… it plumped and smooth out. some of the lines on the bridge of my nose, side crows feet lines  by my eyes, and my nasal fold is smother … not completely but I can see a deep hydration!  I see a Difference and feel it as well!  All those firming products in bottles didn’t work like this and after I was done I massaged it in and used the rest on the mask to massage it into my hands and my feet.!  I even gave a mask when I was done to my husband and he used it on his elbows and feet it has a lot of product In the mask still when your done!.. I definitely will continue to use it and see more improvement for sure and post photos before and after in about a month timeframe !"
These make my face feel moist and smooth. Great purchase!
Smells good but feels thinner than the other products. Dry faster too.
"I have been trying for a while to find different things to help with my skin. I have always had just oily skin that has had breakouts since I was a teen. I haven’t even used it more than once a week (so twice) and my skin already feels better. It’s less oily and I feel like I have less breakouts as well, probably because of the less oil. But I tried the suggestion of putting it in the fridge that is on the package and it feels so nice. After I took it off I immediately started to feel a difference. My skin felt more moisturized than it ever has but also tighter and just healthy for once.10/10 recommend."
Live theseUse once a weekHelps we the wrinkles. And moisturizing
My skin has been super dry and I was looking for something that was hydrating and would not make me break out.My skin looked hydrated and healthy after the first use.  I feel like my dull skin perked right up.  I even feel like my wrinkles look better because my skin is properly hydrated.  Great value for the size and no strange smell.  This brand doesn’t disappoint.
I have been using this nightly for the last year and I love how well it moisturizes my face and my skin loves me for it. I have rosacea and it’s nice and gentle on my skin. Highly recommend.
"I purchased this product a couple of years ago. It has been a while since I used it last. But apparently, I have to write a review. I mainly used it as a day cream, as my skin is super, super dry. I am 64y/o and our skin dries out as we age. It kept my face moisturized, but I felt my skin needed a bit more. So I used this, in combination with 'THE RED JAR' you see on the tv commercials. This was my perfect recipe. Then I just started using The Red Jar Micro-Sculpting Cream and added a drop of Vitamin C and Jojoba oil, and WALAH!! I've used that ever since. I think this is my forever regimen."
Piel muy Hidratada
"I have very dry skin to the point my face was flaking no matter what I tried. After one use this has cleared up probably 90% of the flaking and I didn't have to reapply after an hour or 2. I also have sensitive skin and this hasn't caused any irritation. It is fragrance free so it just smells like the ingredients which isn't the best smell but it is so mild it is gone within a few minutes. I didn't want this to work as well as it does due to the price, but it is well worth it and a little product goes a long way."
"This product is amazing and I strongly recommend anyone wanting hydration in their skin to purchase this! I frequently use this as hand lotion because it instantly hydrates my dry skin and I love it. I have not used a skincare product as moisturizing as this is. I normally don’t wash the mask off and keep it on overnight, which works great and I wake up with hydrated skin. If you’re looking for the best hydrating product, this is lovely and very underrated.Scent: The scent isn’t perfumed which I love because it’s good for the skin, however some people might dislike it as it does have a strong smell at first in my opinion."
"It pills A LOT. If you don't use any other products under it, it might be fine but if you do... It is very pilly. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned it."
"I struggle with dry skin in the winter, and this year I was also dealing with some skin barrier damage after using a product that was too harsh on my skin and caused extra dryness. My regular moisturizer wasn’t cutting it so I tried this product, and it really helped! My skin was already doing better after one use.I put it on at the end of my skincare routine and it does wonders for moisturizing the skin."
love using this as it just makes my skin feel so hydrated
"I was experiencing dryness on my face -- specifically around my eyebrow area -- and applied this nightly, as instructed. I would wake up with continually dry skin and it did not help at all. Moreover, when I requested a refund (twice) I never heard back. If you are looking for a helpful product, I would not recommend spending money on this."
Loved the texture. Skin feels hydrated and smooth
I would describe this more as a heavy duty night cream than a mask. It’s good but nothing amazing as I had hoped.
"It is great but for my very dry skin, it is not enough.  I applied it accordingly to the instructions before going to sleep.  It worked better than some other products but still felt dry'ish the next morning. Will try on other brands next time."
"I have sensitive skin, and this time I was looking for a moisturizing product with collagen. I decided to try the Collagen Hydrating Sheet Masks. Unfortunately, with age, my skin becomes drier, so it requires special care.These masks immediately caught my attention because they not only promise hydration and skin elasticity but also, according to the manufacturer, have anti-aging effects.Usually I use this once a week. If you have enough time, I would recommend keep it in the refrigerator for a bit beforeapplying. This adds a feeling of freshness and relaxation, although even without this, I feel my skin is filled with moisture each time. After using the mask, my face looks brighter and noticeably smoother.As I mentioned earlier, I have sensitive skin, so a mask that doesn’t cause irritation is very important for me. During and after use, I didn’t experience any redness, which sometimes happens with other products.Probably the only downside of this product is that when you open the packaging, it can leak a little.In conclusion, I am very satisfied with the quality and price of these masks. I can say that I will buy them again and can recommend them to anyone looking for moisturizing masks without aggressive ingredients."
"The delivery was horrible but the collagen mask is wonderful!! It smells fresh, effective and after 15 minutes the skin is so supple!! I LOVE these masks!! And they don’t expire until 2027!! Holy grail for facial masks!! :3"
"I’ve only used 2 out of the entire pack and I really love the moisturizing quality of these masks. I haven’t had any skin irritation, as it has been working amazingly."
So far these are the best face masks i have gotten. once a week i pop one in the fridge as i’m doing my night time routine and then use it afterwards and it leaves my face feeling so refreshed! they leave my face feeling smooth and looking bright. definitely recommend
I did feel soreness and my skin looked healthy but it didn’t look like any of the reviews I saw
Great effect on skin brightness. Easy to use and good value for the money
good facial mask that for daily routine.
"I honestly don't think it helps me at all. Certain masks actually cause more damage to my skin than good. They feel great on, but when I take them off it just looks bad and about 10 minutes later my skin gets irritated. The ceramide is the worst about it. Collagen is the only one that doesn't hurt my skin."
Fühlt sich gut auf der Haut an.
朝晩涼しい為、肌保湿が必要だったので良かったです。
たまたまセールやってたので購入してみました。今まで色んなパックを試して来たけどこれが1番、パックをやった感を実感しました。美白でツルツルになった気がします。もうすでにリピしました
美容液たっぷりなので、朝も使用しています首から腕までつけます
いつももう少し濃厚なパックを使っているので、少し物足りない感はありましたが…暑い夏の季節はちょうどいいかもです。
This is the best mask I have ever used.  Pleasant smell and non painful.  After rinsing it off I saw immediate results - my skin was brighter and tighter.  Will definitely continue using this product.
"Love it just after the first use!  My skin looks really great, bright, clean, calms my skin. A little goes a long way. Smells great, very clean and natural scent. It really just does every thing it says it would. I was surprised because not many things I’ve tried calm my skin like this. I have very sensitive with Rosacea. I absolutely love it! I will definitely buy it again."
"Price (5/5): The Pumpkin Honey Glycolic Mask is available at an affordable price. The quantity per package is generous, and although I have used it twice, it seems I can easily get 20-30 uses out of it.Quality (5/5): Made from natural ingredients, the mask feels similar to homemade ones and not like those laden with chemicals. This is perfect for someone like me who doesn’t have time to prepare different masks at home. You just need to apply it for 10-20 minutes and voilà—it works its magic. For optimal results, I apply it twice a week.Smell (3/5): The mask has a distinct pumpkin and honey aroma, which reflects its use of natural ingredients. It also contains glycolic acid. I’ve read a few reviews where people experienced a burning sensation. Having combination skin and previous experience with similar products, I did not experience any tingling sensations, perhaps because my skin is accustomed to it.Overall, this face pack is excellent for skin brightening. It’s ideal for those who prefer natural products but lack the time or ingredients to make them at home."
"I recently tried out the Andalou Naturals Brightening Mask, Pumpkin Honey Glycolic, and I have to say, I'm impressed! At first, I was a bit taken aback by the tingling sensation on my skin, but I soon realized that it was just the glycolic acid and vitamin C doing their job. After washing off the mask, my skin felt so soft and looked noticeably brighter. I love the fact that this mask is both exfoliating and brightening, making it perfect for those days when my skin is feeling a bit dull.One thing I absolutely loved about this mask is the scent. The pumpkin and honey aroma is just divine and adds a luxurious touch to the masking experience. I also appreciate that this product is made with natural ingredients, which is a huge plus in my book.Overall, I would highly recommend the Andalou Naturals Brightening Mask to anyone looking to improve the look and feel of their skin. While the tingling sensation may take some getting used to, the results are well worth it. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed!"
"I really do like this pumpkin mask .It's a gel like consistency and I don't need alot to cover my face it spreads out very well.At first use I felt a slight burning sensation, not a bad one by any means it's what to be expected with products that contain Glycolic in them.Tells me it's doing something good for my face.Anyway I left on 15 min or so and though I didn't notice any difference that gave me that wow factor i did feel as though my face was smooth and very soft.I also noticed my skin looked brighter as well.A nice natural color.The pumpkin honey scent is very light and nice ,not over powering at all for me.Im gonna use twice a week and continue to repurchase because I do like the feeling it leaves my face after and the ingredients are so much better than products than contain all bad ingredients that cause damage.I try and buy products especially face products that are natural so this is a winner for me.The seller was fantastic, they shipped fast and delivery to packaging was perfect! I will purchase from them again."
"This mask is good for very occasional use for pampering my skin, I stick to the same basic skincare products that I love so I allow myself to splurge on mask products with different textures, feels, and scents. This brand has good products at good prices so I own a few.This one I bought specifically looking for an enzyme mask of pumpkin or papaya because there was one I loved so much for my skin that isn’t made anymore. This product has a good smell but I have to be careful with it because it can burn a little and turn me red. It doesn’t seem to hurt my skin as long as I don’t leave it on too long or use it too often. It does seem to be brightening, but I use it rarely for the texture and scent- it was a good price, but I’m not sure I love it enough to repurchase it since there are so many more I want to try. It’s good for a pampering experience but not something I would use regularly. I would repurchase it possibly, just saying not for steady use. It is not the best suited for sensitive skin."
Awesome at refreshing and exfoliating the skin. Love the smell and natural ingredients. Will continue to purchase.
Spa quality mask. Affordable price. Great for sensitive skin. Smells amazing! Really refreshes skin giving it a glowing complexion. Drys in about 15 minutes. Easy to wash off. Highly recommend!
Rend la peau glow
"Amazing mask, my skin is so much radiant right after the first use, I did not expect such efficiency. I see a blatant difference ! However it stinks and I feel tingles (slightly burning) the 5 first minutes of each use. I also experienced redness the first time, but it's glycolic acid so it's expected ! Nothing to worry about."
"Geel goed product, ik veel plezier"
"I got this after reading reviews on Apple news and I have to say it’s a lovely mask, tingles a bit which I know it’s meant to.Skin felt nice and soft and left my skin glowing.Definitely recommend"
"Apenas la eh usado una vez así que actualizaré después, pero por lo pronto el olor y la textura me gustaron muchísimo, tienen un olor fuerte a canela, y como a pay de 🎃, soy de piel sensible y arde un poco durante los primeros minutos algo así como un calorsito pero es soportable. La deje 15 minutos y siento más suavela piel y los parches resecos se sienten menos.🎃🎃 Edit: Estoy usando el gel exfoliante de Mario Badescu pero cuando s eme acabe la compraré de nuevo. La sola experiencia de aplicar la mascarilla con esos olores y consistencia me encanta y tambien es mas efectiva."
"This mask is well worth the price. It goes on so nicely since it’s in the tube, your hands don’t get messy. It smells lovely and light, and my skin feels smooth after using it. I will buy this again and again."
"Amazing. I have acne prone skin, red spots from old acne scars, and have never had smooth clear skin. Within a week of using it I noticed a huge difference in not only my acne but my red spots/discoloration. For the first time in ten years I feel comfortable not wearing foundation. Just buy it."
"Obsessed with this mask! Feels good, no scent, and leaves skin feeling so clean. Now exploring other skin care products from Tula."
"I absolutely love this clay mask. It ""rolls"" on your face so you don't have to really use your fingers to spread it on, maybe just around the nose area. With the pandemic still going on, I also love that real Tula products are on Amazon!"
"I got this product because I wanted a lightweight and easily removable mask that would help tighten my face and not leave it feeling like I just put a layer of concrete on. The stick is honestly great, it smells really good, is very lightweight and comes off gently. I have oily skin, and this doesn't make it feel more oily, but also doesn't make it feel less. After the ten minutes, when I take it off, my face does feel brighter, smoother and softer, but I have not seen the tightening aspect that it advertises and would say it's a mediocre product if you have oily skin. I still use it, but definitely will find something more suitable for my skin in the future."
This is amazing--a clay  mask that is super easy to use & super  results--I must be dreaming! No more clay mess or arduous clean-up after this mask. It smells amazing & it will last forever--and it even made my skin look fabulous after--ha! Best purchase ever!
All Tula products are amazing. This mask makes your face feel tighter and brighter after one application.
"The product works, but because of the ingredients in the product it likely contains phthalates. I highly recommend if you don't know what that is you look it up because it contributes to harmful hormal imbalance. There are better brands that focus on clean skincare like Farmacy.TULA, I recommend you focus on make you products more health conscious. I won't buy this again."
"A beauty secret that never goes out of style, this  essential old-world treatment leaves your skin feeling soft, refreshed and revitalized. Because the clay is so water soluble you can make your mask as thick and cakey or as light and sheer as you like, depending upon your particular preference. It’s a fantastic value for the price and volume of treatment. The clay is an earth color of course, it goes on with your fingers and you determine how long you want the mask to set for its full potency. I am over 50 and my daughter is in her 20s — we both use it and have obviously very different skin needs. 5 stars!"
"I heard sooo many great things about this product and after using it for the past few months I can confirm the magic is real. I feel like it sheds dead skin and removes dark spots extremely well. I apply it to my face and neck biweekly, and have started using it on other dark spots (knees + elbows) and I see a huge difference! There is an extra refreshing tingly feel after you wash it off, removing any grimy oily blocked pore mood your skin may be in! I came back from holiday with a tan and I feel it may have removed a layer or two of my tan :D If you have sensitive skin, definitely do a skin test before using!Tip: Don't overdo it or keep it on longer than the directions advise."
"As a super holistic person, I’m always on the lookout for natural remedies, and this bentonite clay has been a game-changer for me!I love mixing it with apple cider vinegar to create a detoxifying face mask—my skin feels so refreshed and rejuvenated afterward.It’s also my go-to for family detox baths; just combine it with Epsom salt, and it works wonders whenever anyone is feeling under the weather. I appreciate that it has only one natural ingredient, making it a pure and effective choice.Highly recommend for anyone looking to enhance their wellness routine!"
Works well with water but apple cider vinegar might not be for everyone and can cause breakouts if mixed well application can be easy u just have to get a nice layer on the skin I would say the value for money is reasonable compared to other face masks leaves face comfortably
"Results: I used this mask on all acne prone areas and it definitely sucked out all of my clogged pores and evened out my skin texture really nicely. all while tightening the pores back up. (see terrible pic last slide for before) It stung quite a bit towards the end of the drying and left very strong redness (first pic), but skin looks completely fine after a couple hours!Process: I did 50/50 apple cider vinegar and water to add to the powder and used a rubber spatula to applyI let dry completely before using an old rag to rehydrate and wipe off slowlyyyy to minimize irritation. Since i did such an even and smooth layer, i had no problems with sink clogging but i can see why others would have that issue if it was a chunkier mixture!"
"This is hands-down the best face mask ever! I’ve bought it a few times now, and I always mix it with apple cider vinegar for that extra punch (water works too, but where’s the fun in that?). Fair warning: it does *burn* a bit—I've made the boys try it, and they never stop whining about it, but let me tell you, it really gets in there and pulls all the gunk out of your pores!Your face might look like a tomato for a good hour after, but it leaves your skin feeling so soft and seriously detoxified. I recommend this magic in a jar to everyone—it’s a little intense, but totally worth the glow-up!"
"*Disclaimer = This is not an advertisement of any kind but it is a more extensive review than most.Ok all of you with #SkinIssues ~ #Acne, #discoloration, #agespots, #wrinkles, #pores, #scarsI know how hard it is for some of us and how expensive some of the ""solutions"" out there are, so I'm going to share something with you that you're going to thank me for.I've battled #SevereAcne my whole life. I think I've tried everything that is out on the market. I even took something called Acutane in highschool that was so powerful that I remember each pill being individually wrapped with a No Symbol over a picture of a pregnant lady.Out of frustration I began researching and trying almost every skin product that is in the market and compiling reviews from multiple sources. After some trial and error I've found something that is almost magic.I now have a routine of four things that has erased all acne, discoloration and smoothed my wrinkles & scars in two weeks.Here it is:First the facial cleaner (which I believe can be substituted with anyones favorite but I've found this one to work the best for me):1. #Avene Cleansing Foamhttp://www.amazon.com/Avene-Cleansing-Foam-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B00BGCX63O?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s002. #MarioBadescu Facial Spray with Aloe, Herbs and Rosewater (Amazon will try to get you to buy the ""add on"" which is only a dollar less but half the oz, so look at the size options.) I put this on after washing as well as use it to set my makeup. It is amazing.http://www.amazon.com/Mario-Badescu-Facial-Spray-Rosewater/dp/B00172O9NO?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s003. #LevenRose Organic 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Natural Jojoba Oil, 4 oz (This and the Facial Spray are the most important parts of this. This product is incredible. You can also use it as a makeup remover, its great for hair as well as stretch marks and cellulite ((yes, I'm telling you the truth.) It also lasts a couple of months.http://www.amazon.com/Leven-Rose-Organic-Pressed-Unrefined/dp/B00GJX58PE?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s004. #AztecSecrets: Indian Healing Bentonite Clay (The larger oz is also only a couple of dollars more and will last you a couple of years.)http://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secrets-Indian-Healing-Bentonite/dp/B00N528HIC?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00I wash my face, then its important to let your face dry. Then the spray (let dry) and finally the Jojoba oil. I also use the spray and oil after the mask, which heals and seals your pores.Since I've been using this routine, my skin looks luminous and almost 10 years younger. I'm not joking. I've bought the most expensive products on the market and none of them compare to these which are a 1/10th of the cost.Let me know if any of you try it. I'm not selling any of these or making any money or anything for telling you all this. I'm just so incredibly pleased and surprised that I couldn't not tell people."
"I got this for my gf and I. She heard a lot of good stuff about this product but never tried it yet. So she's very excited when this came in the mail. She likes DIY facials so this is perfect as one of her ingredients.Pros: It's a great price for the amount of clay. The amount of clay was actually more than expected, which is awesome. We love that it's packed in a nice sturdy container, it just feels much more quality this way. She loves that it's ""calcium"" bentonite clay, which apparently is more healing than sodium bentonite clay she says, and also harder to find for a decent price. After trying it out with just apple cider vinegar, our skin felt soft and looks brighter. Very refreshing feeling. Some of my acne seem to have calmed down and is less red. It's been an hour now since I used the mask, and usually my face would be super oily by now - but it's not after using the clay mask.Cons: We wish there was a seal on the inside of the container because when I opened it, clay powder started to spray and pour everywhere and around the rim of the container. It's just a bit messy, but luckly its just clay so it's easy to clean.Final thought: I recommend anyone with acne to try this product, especially people with oily skin like myself. It's also great for those who are into DIY skincare stuff. The quality of this product is great and the price is amazing. I would buy again when this container runs out."
So I'm a little late to the party with this as I've only just discovered it... tried it for the first time yesterday. I mixed ¾ a teaspoon of this with ½ teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and left it in for 15 minutes... my face was really red when I took it off but that went after a couple of hours but it did leave my face feeling very soft and looking good!  This tub is huge and it will  last such a long time!
"I'm in my 60's.  I have been using anti-wrinkle cream for over 3 decades, a lot of them are high end product.  I've searching top 10 anti-wrinkle cream every year.I used this product twice (just mixed with water).  My friend asked me why my skin looks so good and silky recently.  I never expect a cheap product with such amazing effect.  The only product that surprised me is 100% vitamin E oil (not to apply on eye/eye bag area), which I could see immediate skin improvement.The 3rd time I mixed it with applecider vinegar.  I felt a bit of burning sensation and my skin looked red for quite a while after washing.  Still with amazing effect!It's a bit messy as I've to mix it myself.  I applied thick layers on my face, then neck.  I put the residue on my arm, just thin layers.  My arms do not look much improvement.  It seems only thick layers work.I highly recommend this product.  It's very natural, does not smell.  I don't feel chemicals in there, thus saves me money to keep a good look.I would suggest to use it before showers, wash it in bath tub, as the mud could clog the sink eventually (especially those with water saver faucet)."
Really good product love it we all use it as a family amazing
"This is my first time trying clay masks. (I started getting into skincare over the CoVID lockdowns.) I have experimented with this a lot and come to realize that it might be slightly too irritating for my sensitive skin. At least, I need to only leave it on for no longer than 10 minutes. I'll be honest, that at first, I was leaving it on for a very long time: 30, or even 45 minutes. This was too long, which i realized but I was ""gung ho"" or something. (Reckless!) I would try to stick to the maximum intended time of 15 minutes if you are just starting out with this. I think the long time does dry out the skin and I don't think that was ultimately healthy for my sensitive combination skin. Maybe it would be OK if I just put it on my t-zone.Anyways, what I find this really great for is for hair masks! mixing with apple cider vinegar, I put this on my hair and leave it for about an hour, then rinse out with cool water. It leaves my hair clean and extremely soft. This is especially useful for anyone looking to transition toward ""No Shampoo,"" because I have been able to use it once every 1-2 weeks and my hair has been very clean and actually in the best condition it's ever been in, in my life. This clay is a very helpful product for bridging the transition toward no shampoo."
Very soothing for after sun use.
"I’ve got a really sensitive oily face and have been having a hard time controlling it. I’ve finally found something to help me.I know that we are all different, but I would recommend you give this item a try. I admit I was hesitant but,  It truly was calming for me. After using it , my face felt lighter and less irritated. Especially around my nose. The effects after using it lasted for a few days… very soothing mask."
Truly an excellent face mask.
"i was very pleased with the results.the masks are great for highly sensitive skin and are hydrating. they leave a nice finish, very glowy and light while also hydrating, cooling and moisturizing, will definitely be purchasing more."
Great for softening your skin and mositurizing
"Jimin of BTS recommended this sheet mask in one of his lives. Then, when I went to the AGUST D concert, the army who sat next to me gifted me 3 of these sheet masks along with some Yoongi photocards <33 The sheet masks are simply amazing. They hydrate my skin and my pores have gotten much better after using them couple of times. Definitely recommend!!"
"These masks as amazing. I have tried many different kinds and these are my favorite. I have combination skin. I use these before going to bed to help heal, prevent, etc. while I sleep. It is calming for the skin and makes me not want to pick at my skin. The material is very soft and almost translucent yet has enough hold for the ample amount of product that you get. Meaning it does not feel heavy when you put it on your face or uncomfortable as some masks do. The product does not have a tacky feel or smell. There is extra serum to pat on after putting the mask on and even after you take it off if you want. The fit of the make is also nice in that the slits are well placed for making it easier to smooth the mask out where needed. Overall a solid purchase for the price if you are looking for a mask to add to your routine I helping with acne. *the mask will not clear up acne completely and you will most likely need to use other products, but it is calming and helps your skin feel less irritated."
Love love love. No breakouts and doest burn even on post tret face. Will be buying again as soon as I run put.
"The face masks work really well. There is a lot of product left over in the bag, so you can easily apply to neck as well."

La sensación agradable y de relax que deja en la piel
The best face masks by far & brilliant value!
"I don't write many reviews, but I had to for this product. I used to make and sell my own line of organic skincare products. Now that I am out of the game, I'm always on the lookout for great indie companies to support. I read about the Blue Tansy mask on a beauty blog that gave it such glowing reviews I immediately wanted to try it. Then I saw how much it cost, and I was gobsmacked. $50 is a lot to spend on a mask. My skin is pretty healthy, as skin goes. (Mostly genetics, folks. Anyone who says differently is selling something.) I am, however, extremely fair, so I have a fair amount of redness and sun damage. The blog I read said again and again how this helped her with her redness and sun damage, so I saved my pennies and gave it ago. I was immediately taken with the minimalist packaging, and the smell of the product. You can smell it through the box, but it is in now way overpowering. It's a beautiful cool and woodsy scent. The mask is blue in the jar, but goes on clear. The smell is super relaxing, and it feels so cool and delicious on your face. It's more like a gel mask than a mud mask, only not as sticky. The box said there could be some tingling, but I haven't experienced it. I waited the allotted time and rinsed my face. I didn't expect an immediate difference, but there was one. My skin looked calm, no redness, and dewy. I actually gasped when I looked in the mirror. I've been using it twice a week for a few weeks, and the jar still looks full, so you get a lot of product for the price. Also, it might literally be magic. I keep joking with my partner that it must be fairy blood. (Gory, yes, but that's how good it is.) I very highly recommend this to anyone who needs their skin to calm down, but especially to folks struggling with redness and sun damage. It's incredible."
"This is one of my favorite products. I only wish it came in a larger size! I read the negative reviews on this product and want to give a heads up on a few things to anyone who is thinking of buying this product:1. This is a resurfacing mask. It uses enzymes to remove dead skin from the surface of your face, and this includes removing surface-level blemishes, improving the appearance of the skin. It is not specifically intended to moisturize the skin. I do no think it is drying, but moisturizing is not the stated intent of the product.2. Resurfacing can be slightly painful. This mask does tingle and even burns ever-so-slightly, but overall it is a very mild resurfacer and many are more painful.3. This is not a mud mask or a paper mask or a peel mask. It is a bluish-green, runny gel. It is reminiscent of slime. It goes on in a clearish-bluish-green and is difficult to remove with just water. Gentle removal with a cloth is recommended.4. This product is not scented with perfumes. Therefore, it smells like blue tansy, which has an earthy, almost mushroomy smell. If you are expecting an aromatherapeutic experience, you should look at another product.5. This is not a miracle product. Like any product, you should not expect this product to revolutionize your face overnight. You should use it daily for the first week and then go to a few times per week.6. If your expectations are appropriate, you may love this product. I have acne scars, and within a week I did notice my complexion being much brighter and smooth, with some of the scarring already fading."
"This mask is really great! Nothing negative to say except, it smells like the Flinstone Fruity Pebbles Vitamins I had when I was younger but, its not an awful smell. I have acne and this didn't clear up any existing acne I had but, it made me skin smoother and softer and gave it a glow. If you have congested pores or skin that does not feel smooth to the touch I would buy this if I were you. Or if you're like me and suffer from red blotchy skin, this is a great chemical exfoliator to clear out your pores with. For your first try, use it once a week and give your skin some time to adjust to the Acids, next time you use maybe use one night and then other night 3 or 4 nights later. Using it twice in one week was when I saw the best glowing skin results. Herbivore is a great company I use their rose water as well and love the glow it gives my skin. I hope Herbivore comes out with more products and more acne fighting treatments. It's a great line for sensitive skin!"
"This stuff is magic! I love the way my skin looks after I use it. My skin tone is even, my pores are tiny, and my face is extremely soft.  I was skeptical at first because of the price, but finally decided to try it. So glad I did.Annoying things to keep in mind, but don't let them detour you: It's a pain to paint on your face because it's really runny, and you can't do a thick coat or it will run down. I have a silicone brush that helps a lot. It's also a pain to wash off. I read a review about someone's face turning blue. Probably because it didn't get washed off all the way.. you really have to scrub with warm water. The smell isn't great - keep in mind it's natural ingredients. It also does give a tingly feeling, so just be prepared - it is a ""resurfacing"" mask."
"Just purchased my third jar. I am an African American college student who used to have hyper-pigmentation and oily skin. I needed a good exfoliate to keep my pores from clogging and prevented acne while fading the dark spots. This mask does it all. I can feel the product working and once I wash it off, my face looks brighter and feels so fresh & so clean (clean). In conjunction with the other products in my routine, my skin has improved greatly (like a full pancake face of foundation everyday to now spot-concealing). I continue to purchase this mask for maintenance. The smell (which many people mention as a con) doesn't bother me but some may find it a bit strong. I'm a fan of The Ordinary's products as well -- they also sell an AHA + BHA mask at a much cheaper price point, but IMO it doesn't feel nearly as effective and is messy to apply. You don't need more than a quarter size of this product to treat your entire face. I think this product is well worth the splurge. The reviews on Sephora's site and /r/SkinAddiction say the same."
"So far, I've only used it a handful of times, yet I definitely feel like it's doing something. Leaves skin feeling incredibly soft and looking really smooth (i.e. minimizes the look of pores) immediately after washing off but also throughout the day. Expensive, but worth the splurge if you want to treat your face well, ever so often."
Absolutely love it...You will start noticing difference in your skin within a week of using it..It really improves the skin appearance..makes it clear and glowing..best use it along lapis oil of the same brand..magical!!!
"I recently tried the Freeman Exotic Blends Face Mask Variety Set, and I'm absolutely thrilled with the results! This set has quickly become a staple in my skincare routine, offering a luxurious and rejuvenating spa experience right at home. The variety of masks included in the set is fantastic – each one is uniquely formulated with exotic ingredients to target different skincare concerns. Whether I'm looking to hydrate and nourish my skin, detoxify and purify pores, or brighten and revitalize my complexion, there's a mask for every need. I love how easy they are to apply – the creamy formulas glide on smoothly and evenly, and they feel incredibly soothing and refreshing on the skin. Plus, the masks dry quickly and rinse off easily, leaving my skin feeling soft, smooth, and radiant. Since incorporating these masks into my routine, I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall health and appearance of my skin – it looks clearer, brighter, and more youthful than ever before. Whether you're a skincare enthusiast or just looking to pamper yourself with a little self-care, I highly recommend giving the Freeman Exotic Blends Face Mask Variety Set a try – it's a luxurious treat for your skin that you won't regret!"
"Works well, smell great"
"I love how this set had a variety of masks plus a moisturizer. The peel off masks work better than I anticipated and the clay mask is wonderful! I've only used the gel mask once but will use it again, preferably before bed to let it soak in over night and leave my skin feeling hydrated. The scents are really nice, not too strong but soft enough to give your skin that refreshing sensation. They are also easy to remove, I splashed with water to remove most of the clay mask. Once wet, it was easy to remove excess with a warm washcloth. Will be buying again!"
I actually like them all. I use them for spot treatments or all over. Price is great too. Easy to apply.  Helps clogged pores or general facial treatment.
"Love the smells of all of them, my skin feel so soft and moisturized after I use them. It’s fresh and the ones that are peeling mask do peel well."
"It's really torn on how to review these products. On one hand, they seem to work really well and are an excellent value. On the other hand, my very sensitive skin has had a pretty poor reaction to two of the four.I would recommend this for someone who is looking for cleaner pores and less oily skin, BUT it is probably not for those with sensitive skin."
I absolutely love all 4 of these masks and enjoy the peel off and the clay. ALL 4 of them went on and OFF fabulously! Very impressed especially with how well the peel off comes off literally in one peel. Highly recommend. My skin is glowing.
"Usually when I use face masks my skin responds by overproducing oil and I get all shiny no matter how many times I wash my face. These do not do that to me, and the hemp seed mask removes any oil I need gone. I absolutely will purchase these as long as they’re available now!"
The natural ingredients in this face mask instantly brightened up my face and it’s so refreshing. The skin is a little tacky afterwards but that’s not an issue. I love these!!
"I’ve been using these in place of getting facials and I see a big difference in my skin. The quality is great and it’s such great value because you can do one every day and it’s still cheaper than getting a facial. It takes about an hour to completely dry and afterward, my skin is hydrated! There is absolutely no smell, which I appreciate."
Put it on the fridge before using it.  So nice and refreshing
I was not expecting a miracle because I am in my 60’s. There is no such thing as a facelift in a bottle. I wanted a bit of color and softness and for my skin to feel healthier. These masks helped with that so Im pleased with the products
I love these face masks. I have bought the moisturizing masks and the brightening masks and both have been amazing. I leave them on longer than the 10-20 minute directions. I leave it on til the whole mask is basically dry and they help so much. They make my skin so moisturized and dewy. I have sensitive skin and I have never had a negative reaction from them. The quality is top tier!
I like the Mediheal mask a lot. I just tried this one and it worked so well on my skin. Such a great option to have when your skin can use a little perking up!
Used one time at night and immediately my skin was incredibly smooth and free of any discoloration. My face was still perfect in the morning and now this will be an essential part of my routine at least a few times per week.
"I like the product because it’s very effective,had to order for 2 more"
"I have already used the other sheet masks from the same brand and this one also pretty good same as others. Compared to other expensive sheet mask brands, Medi heal is the No.1 sheet mask brand of any type of skin concern and any skin type. This particular sheet mask has given me results over one use and I would defenitely buy this again."
いくつかシリーズを試した中でビタが一番好き　朝この香りに包まれると元気に1日過ごせそう！とやる気スイッチにもなる　疲れた夜は心が癒されるし本当無くてはならない　自分の中では高いけどご褒美だと思って使い続ける
シリーズの中でもお気に入りです。
メディフィールは以前から何度もリピートして購入しているので期待してましたがこちらは想像してたよりはよくなかったかな一定の保湿力はあるけど、別にコレじゃなくてもドラストで今は良いの出てるから一枚一枚の梱包でこのタイプじゃなくても良いかも
メディヒールパックの中で、これが一番私の肌に合います。ベタつき過ぎずサッパリし過ぎず、ちょうどいいです。
"As someone with oily and acne-prone skin, finding a truly effective deep cleansing mask has been a challenge. The Kiehl's Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Amazonian White Clay Mask, however, has proven to be a purifying delight that revitalizes my skin and minimizes pesky pores.Deep Cleansing Power: The standout feature of this mask is its ability to deeply cleanse and purify the skin.

It's not overpowering, making it suitable for those sensitive to strong scents.Packaging and Quantity: The mask comes in a generously sized jar, and a little goes a long way, making it a cost-effective investment.

Excellent mask . I love it . Really helps to clear out the skin.
Love it’s cleaning effect
I’m in this product is just amazing it just washes your face really well. I just cleans you up and it just makes you feel your face feel fresh and clean. It’s amazing.i’m
"Great face mask for oily skin. I use it once a week, it cleans my skin perfectly, makes it brighter and smooth. Blackheads become a bit lighter."
"This product is an absolute must-have for anyone struggling with clogged pores and oily skin. After just one use, my skin felt so much cleaner and smoother. The formula is gentle yet powerful, and I love how it doesn't dry out my skin. It's a bit on the pricier side, but so worth it for the results. Highly recommend for anyone needing a deep cleanse!"
The product was good
"This was the product when I took the protective cap off… at this point, just make the tub smaller. Probably half full once settled. Otherwise, product as described."
"I have been using this face mask for years and I am in love with it. It helps calm down any inflammation, redness, or irritation in my skin. It helps with oil production. I have an oily T-zone, with larger nose pores, and this is the only thing I've found that has been able to help with managing it. My pores are noticeably smaller after I use it. I would recommend using it once a week! Love it!"
"You cannot go wrong with kiehls. If youre considering it, just go for it! But just dint forget the fact that it is quite small. Its just 28 ml"
"Bin echt überrascht, da es bereits nach der ersten Anwendung zu einer Verbesserung kommt. Die Poren werden gereinigt und verkleinert, ohne die Haut zu reizen."
All the best facemask in my opinion would buy it again as I’m almost running out as lasted over four months and I use it every Monday and Friday
"It feels a little cool and comfortable to use, and my skin is noticeably smoother afterwards, which is friendly to oily skinned people like me."
"I have combination skin that is super oily but also super dry from retinol use, textured, large pores, sensitive, acne prone skin. I bought a sample of this Philosophy Purity Clay Mask from Sephora and I HAD to buy more because I loved it so much. I have used so many different kinds of masks over the years but THIS is the first one that gave me obvious improvement.First, let me start by saying that the price of this stuff is INSANE! So expensive... Of course, I bought it anyway because of how much I loved the sample that I got... but I do wish this was a bit more affordable.The clay itself is white, textured for a nice exfoliation with application, dries quickly/completely/evenly, and has a mild pleasant scent. Just scrub it into your skin and leave it on for 5-10 minutes (I usually do 10 min), and when I wash it off my skin feels so soft and clean! This made a visible difference in my skin after the first use. My pores appeared smaller and my skin just looked overall better. It has salicylic acid and I like to use products with this ingredient when I have breakouts.Overall, masks aren't typically a normal part of my skincare routine since I've never found one that made a difference... until this one! If you are looking for a really good face mask and you don't mind spending the money, I HIGHLY recommend buying this one!Hope this helps!"
This mask is SO GOOD. I have tried a million and have never seen such instant results. My pores are noticeably cleared out and appear smaller after use.
This is a great product! It really exfoliates well and it leaves my skin super soft and glowing. I did not give it 5 stars because it doesn't clear out all my pores but it does a pretty good job-better than any other product I have used.
"This is such a good mask for black heads and minimizing pores, I was so surprised it actually worked"
"Use this at least twice a week and watch those pores disappear! I had such a problem with the visible pores that I resented putting foundation and powder on my nose. Now my nose is so smooth looking and makeup is no problem! Just remember to moisturize after as this may dry out your skin.The routine I highly recommend:Step 1: Clean your face of the dirt and grime with a deep cleaner like Noxzema, use with warm water to open the pores.Step 2: Cleanse your face with the Philosophy - Purity Face Wash (different than the Purity clay mask) to finally melt away the dirt, oil and makeup. This Purity Face Wash also tones and hydrates your skin.Step 3: Following the directions on the bottle, apply the Purity Simple Pore Extractor (clay mask) on your t-zone, chin, and wherever else need be. Leave it on until it drys completely, scrub off with water when done.Vuala!"
Loved this product. You only need a pea size to cover full face and neck. Leave on for full 15 min to benefit your skin. Splash warm water to remove easier than using face cloth or use face remover makeup cloth pads.
This product is excellent.  I have always dealt with blackheads on my nose and surrounding area.  This product absolutely gets rid of them.  I just use once a week.  Worth trying!
product was inexpensive and portable.  Material is very much like an exfoliating scrub not like a mask so di dnot use as frequently due to the grainy texture
I used to be an aesthetician and this product is what we used!! I am 52 now and I use it 2x week. It leaves your face feeling soft and silky and allows product to absorb into the dermal layer to keep skin cells feeling an looking rejuvenating.
I totally wish I'd taken pictures of my face before and after. I've been using it for about a month. My face had really really dark spots. I even saw a dermatologist. So I decided to try this after some research of ingredients. I was completely SHOCKED just after 1 use. After 6 times the effectiveness is definitely TRUE! I am so much better w/o makeup. I love looking in mirror again. This product is now part of my regimen.
"Let me start by saying that the Image Skincare Ageless Total Resurfacing Masque is an absolute game changer. This masque offers an incredibly soothing experience with a beautiful exfoliating effect, leaving your skin feeling rejuvenated and refreshed. The most astonishing part is its ability to effectively clear up blemishes after just one application—it's like pure magic in a jar. Simply apply it for a mere 5 minutes, rinse it off, follow up with your favorite moisturizer, and wake up to a clear, smooth complexion. Trust me, the results are astounding. Prepare to thank me later for introducing you to this life-changing masque."
Love this product.  Love how it makes my skin feel after using it. Highly recommend.
Love it!!
Skin feels amazing afterwards!
"I first got introduce to this by a med spa I went to and I fell in love! I was so happy to find it on amazon. This is a staple! Its a face mask scrub and people, it works! I use it maybe once a week and it leaves my face super soft. No tingle and it does not scratch your face like other very fine face scrub products. 10/10 recommend"
"I have always loved this product. But “seriously”, the tube I received is almost empty. For 30.00, it didn’t make me happy."
This is by far the best mask for aging oily skin with enlarged pores for me. The product came original under a protective film and a good expiration date
"Bought this from RYBRM Trading.  It is the real deal came in a plastic wrap seal and was a fraction of the price I pay through a salon.  I love IMAGE products and his face masque brings out impurities and smooths the skin.  Great for exfoliating and clearing blackheads on the nose and eliminating spots around the jawline.  This product does bring out impurities, but it also can eliminate existing ones.  It is a superb product and the best face masque I have used."
"Prodotto da me già utilizzato.I prodotti di questa linea cosmetica li trovo di grande qualità ed efficacia.Questa maschera è una maschera esfoliante all acido salicilico, rende la pelle liscia e luminosa senza seccarla. Utilissima per contrastare l’invecchiamento cutaneo ma anche al fine di pulire a fondo la pelle e limitare il formarsi di punti neri.La spedizione è stata rapidissima e il prezzo davvero ottimo"
"Le encantó a mi esposa, sintió un cambio en la piel desde el primer dia de uso quedo muy contento con está mascarilla."
Exactly what I wanted
"The box says to leave on for 20 or 30 minutes, however, I had them on for almost 3 hours. They say when the mask dries it dries clear. It took a couple hours for that to happen. When I took it off, my face looked smooth and shiny all day long! I didn’t wear anything else on my face all day. I will definitely buy these again! They didn’t have any smell on them. They felt amazing!"
"I waited until my second use to really see results. The first time I've use it my skin was glassy but I really did not see to much difference in the elasticity of my skin. The appearance wasn't what I expected from all the videos I've seen. It's easy to apply just use gravity for it to stick. I went to bed with it and had no issues. My skin gets irritated with almost everything and with this it didn't so that a plus for me.Second time using it about a week later the results were amazing. It was glassy, smooth, my fine lines were so soft. So my advice is don't expect at the first try you will look like all those videos, they've been using this for a while. You will see the difference every time you use it, it will get better. I would recommend.P.S I just order another."
"I put the first one on about 15 minutes before I went to bed and sat still, It kept sliding a bit, so I tilted my head back a bit and it still slid a little bit .. then when I felt it was kind of in place I tried go to sleep because it says you can sleep with it on, I guess that’s if you lie perfectly still because mine only lasted, about 85 minutes and it was off and I wasn’t able to piece it back together to go on again!Pretty easy to put on at first a bit slimy the mask can tear easily trying to move it into place a few times, you have to gently pull it up after it slides off.Fit my face well after 85 minutes my skin felt about 20% better. I’m also an aesthetician so I’m looking forward to trying the other three - fingers crossed, I’ll have to give it a shot when I have 3 to 4 hours downtime according to the directions because there’s no way it’s going to stay on my face while I sleep if I turn on my side.* update - I was able to try the second one and left it on for three hours, my skin looked fabulous after, lasted about 48 hours definitely increased the hydration smoothed out fine lines so it would be perfect to use before a night out a reunion or anything like that hopefully I’ll see a difference after using the last two that’ll last a little longer.."
"SUPER moisturizing! Although it’s thick, it doesn’t slide off your face. Easy to apply! After 2 hours the mask began to turn from white to clear. I felt glowy, moisturized and not sticky after this mask. Love that it came in a multi pack!"
"Always skeptical about Tiktok trends and Amazon beauty products, but this mask is amazing. The package says to leave on for 30-40 minutes, but I left it on for a few hours while I did homework and my skin is absolutely amazing. It feels great and looks so hydrated, the product felt great and smelled nice."
"This has become my absolute favorite mask! I do this about once a week and my skin is GLOWING after. I put them in the fridge and it feels so good on my skin it also helps to keep it from sliding off your face. This mask almost acts as a suction on your face so you can literally sleep with it on all night and it won’t come off. My skin is glowing, incredibly moisturized and plump when I take it off. A must try!"
"It’s always a skeptical process when buying something based off of someone else’s review, but these masks work just as I’ve seen! From the hardening of the mask (over 2 hours! But worth it) to the after-feel! My face felt.. youthful?! Idk, but it looks and feels amazing! My pores look smaller or cleaner, the smell is non-bothersome, pleasant even and my skin feels moisturized! I love how many come in a pack, and the size really doesn’t matter! If you have a smaller face, you can overlap the mask and it’ll still work!  The overlapped parts may take longer to absorb and go clear but the 2 hours is just a suggestion. The mask is beneficial in 30-40 minutes anyway :)"
"The mask was very hydrating, and felt amazing when I put it on. It was cooling and there was no scent, which was a plus. It took a while for it to dry enough to stop slipping, and it does tear pretty easily. If you're wanting to sleep in it, you should plan on having at least a couple of hours to let it dry first. After it starts to dry, it stays in place without a problem. For me the fit was a little off, but I just made two small cuts around the nose and one at the eyes and it fit just fine after that. It stayed on overnight without any issues. In the morning my skin felt hydrated, but kind of sticky. I didn't notice any changes in my fine lines and wrinkles."
"I recently ordered this collagen mask, and I must say, I’m extremely impressed with the results! After just a few uses, my skin feels noticeably smoother, more hydrated, and rejuvenated. The mask is gentle, yet very effective, leaving a glowing complexion without any irritation. The ingredients feel high quality, and I love how easy it is to apply and remove.The seller was also fantastic! The package arrived promptly, in perfect condition, and was well-packaged. Overall, an amazing experience both with the product and the seller. I highly recommend this collagen mask to anyone looking to improve their skincare routine. I will definitely be ordering again!"
I will not be buying this again. It rips so easily and doesn’t feel hydrating. It has a factory smell. It’s not a legit korean face mask.
"These are great and a pretty good price point when you buy them in a bundle. They work for all skin types in my opinion, my skin is always so soft and hydrated after using and tames breakouts. Give them a try, they’re very gentle and have worked really well for me"
"ok so i got these because i really trust this brand and was hoping that the cactus mask could clear up my breakout. let me tell you, this mask is the best skincare product i've ever tried! 100/10!"
This is great budget friendly option as a gift. It also makes your face feel refreshing
Doesn't cause breakouts and feels really nice on the face
I had high hopes. Kinda disappointed. Not a bad mask but not the best either. Im a face mask junkie.. So of coarse I'll buy again.. But facetory has better mask.
I love these they’re so good for skin and are very affordable!! I always add these onto a gift for someone.
This was a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter. She loved them.
amazon always has great steals! loved this still have theam apply one once a week! i was looking for a bundle for cheap and this name too came across it love it works asome
It was a gift for my granddaughter and she loved them.
"Love these masks! Great value, way more expensive at Sephora for the exact same masks. They work great and skin looks amazing afterwards"
"I got this pack for a fun girl’s night after using the Tony Moly rose gel sleep mask and loving it. The sheet masks work well, no issues with skin allergies or sensitivities the only downside (which adds to the fun) is they don’t seem to fit the average face very well! The nose area ripped and the don’t cling to the face all that well but they still work and are fun for a sleepover or ladies night"
"Peel off masks work so well to exfoliate and keeping your skin soft. Pretty good value for the money, takes a bit to dry but I just sit in front of a fan. Now that summer is over, this is perfect to get your skin ready for the colder weather."
"I just used this this evening and I'll share my thoughts with you all.It goes on THICK. I have used several masks of the jelly/peel off sort, and none were as thick as this. It makes it really easy to apply since it's not runny at all! You just have to get used to the feel is all.Smell is fine, kind of like raspberry. It's faint and doesn't last long.Dry time is average for a jelly peel off. Totally dry in about half an hour.Because it's so thick, it peels off super easily! No having to pick and pick at strands left on your face - this comes off in one solid piece.My face feels nice and smooth, and is a bit brighter. I really enjoyed this, and will definitely use it more!"
"I used this Freeman product a few times but not something I loved.  It works ok, dries and peels ok, but not something I would repurchase.  I didn't feel any difference after I had used the product and ended up giving it to my daughter.  She uses it and likes it.It smells great, and the application is easy.  Just be sure to apply the right amount.  Not too much, or it won't dry, and not a super thin coat or it won't peel off in a nice sheet."
"This product smells great, it is very easy to apply, and once you remove the mask, it leaves your skin feeling very soft and glowing."
"Awesome gel mask that peels off with ease. I let it sit for about 30 minutes and it cooled and then stiffened. When it was time to take it off, I rubber my forehead to get it started and the rest came off really easy.  It took off the top layer of dirt and my face felt really good after. Super easy to apply although it is a little sticky so watch out for any hair. It was the best priced mask I found and I highly recommend it."
I received this today and it was not sealed! You could tell the product had been used . This definitely does not have 6fl Oz. Neither does the other product I had bought from similar seller. Seems to me product is being used and sold. I would give this 5 stars. But knowing the product had been used and it was not stated. Otherwise the product smells good and leaves skin soft.
"Love this face mask, it makes my face clean, shiny and smooth after peeling it off. And it smells so good! Definitely recommend it!"
The effect on my skin was good. It felt so soft so the mask.
It is so satisfying to peel this off my face.  My face feels smooth and soft.  I highly recommend.  Great price too!
"Peau propre et douce après application,attention à n'en mettre qu'une fine couche,sinon très long à sécher.Se décolle très bien,aspect net de la peau,parfum très agréable."
"i've been using this facemask for years now and i love it so much, the price is okay- not too expensive- and i love the scent. it gives an overall fresh and hydrating feel and isn't strong on sensitive and dry skin <3"
"No me parece que sea tan maravilloso, lo llevo utilizando un par de semanas (dos veces por semana) y no veo grandes efectos.Esta bien como mascarilla peel off, seca en unos 15 minutos aproximadamente y es fácil de retirar. Pero no tiene gran adherencia por lo que no resulta muy limpiadora."
"Reinigt und klärt die Haut, die Haut fühlt sich frisch und weich an."
"I use these and have bought them as gifts for friends who also love them. They are cute, and my skin looks and feels good afterward. I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no redness or problems at all with these masks! Good value."
"I got these for a birthday sleepover and the girls absolutely loved the characters. They were all about the age of 7-8 and were slightly big on their faces around the sides but it fit fine around their eyes, nose, and mouth. Very easy to apply and moisturizing. Was definitely a great price for the number you get and it made for fun times for the girls! Would buy again!"
"Super cute, we have lots of fun together on our home spa nights."
"We got these as a funny Christmas gift for our kids and they thought they were hilarious! They are very slimy though, I thought more so than other sheet masks but it was a fun gag gift."
"Received a pack of 6 animal masks which come in a variety of other types of themes. Very affordable to buy and is good for kids. There was no reaction from the masks and it fit my daughtets face perfectly. Smells fine, no weird odor."
I knew my daughter would love these. Each animal mask were so cute. It didn't take not time for her to use these
"As a single mom of 2 boys, I rarely pamper myself. I bought these for my boys (10 and 12) so they could do an at home mini spa day with me. Not only did they have fun with the crazy way they look with them on, they liked the way their skin felt afterwards. Will be purchasing more!"
I will be using these for a girls night!!  Fun and moisturizing
"I keep purchasing these face masks because they are just so good, I struggle with extremely dry skin and can’t tell you how much these face masks did for me. My skin looks amazing and they don’t irritate my face, not only that I could tell the difference instantly from before I used these masks to now I 100% recommend definitely worth the money."
"This is one of my favorite sheet masks. Little pricey for me but worth it. I switch off between this one and the COSRX snail mucin sheet mask. I mostly look forward to this one though, not only for the hydration and long term glow it gives but I love the way it fits and stays on my face. Probably one of the best fitting masks, not too big where theres overlapping everywhere, the eyes, nose, and mouth are placed perfectly and it stays put! Doesn’t slide around like other masks. Theres enough product in the package where theres some left over to rub on your neck/arms but not so much that it’s dripping off the mask making a mess all over the sink. This is the only mediheal mask I’ve tried, I’d like to try others but I have sensitive skin so haven’t pulled the trigger yet.Will upload a photo later! **"
I believe the hype! Left my skin feeling dewy fresh and so soft.
"I left my skin, healthy and glowing."
"I can use this mask daily - night or morning.  The sheet mask has a thin transparent color, stays in place while on, and feels soothing on my skin. When removed, the remaining serum leaves a sticky feel till dried. Once dried, it leaves that glassy appearance. I use primer before applying makeup, so the shine goes away & makeup goes on fine. Overall,  I like the feel and price. Recommend."
"I keep buying it , it helps hydrating my face .Good quality."
I'm currently wearing the yellow one. Pulling it out I was pleasantly surprised that this mask was *JUICY* lol. It was soaked in serum but didn't drip all over the place when I was unfolding it like most others do. It also seemed to fit better than most other masks. I love the quality of skin care that mediheal puts out and will continue to buy from them.
"These mask are very nice.  Easy to use and very effective.  My skin looked  great after applying the mask, then removing 20 minutes later."
"Helps brighten and hydrate face leaving it smooth and bright! I use this twice a week and I love the results so far, will be repurchasing again!"
used to it. It is suitable for moisturizing.
"Ogni maschera che ho provato ha mantenuto l’effetto promesso, idratano, danno luce e levigano lasciando la pelle morbida e migliorando la texture.. hanno un prezzo davvero competitivo per la qualità del prodotto! Le ricomprerò!"
痛くならないしもちもちだしずっと使いたい。もう少し安くなってくれたら本当に嬉しい。でも買う。もちもちになれるから。
"Fast delivery. Products received in very good, bubble wrapped condition. Box not dented and each mask has clear expiry indication. Thanks seller for the free gift too.Just tried it y'day and it was hydrating yet moisturising. Very happy with the purchase 👍"
"My skin type:- Very Dry, easily dehydrated- Oily nose- Prone to stubborn acne and closed comedones- Redness on chin and cheeks (not rosacea)I already use a nightly Tretinoin cream (.04% concentration) to help with my acne and premature signs of aging but decided with my derm that incorporating a BHA would be a good idea to help with my seriously stubborn closed comedones and some irritating textural issues. It was between this and the Cerave SA lotion and I ultimately decided on this due to the higher concentration of salicylic acid.It's moisturizing, and feels sticky for the first 5-10 minutes after application but seems to sinks in to something of a satin finish on me and I can no longer feel it on my skin. You just have to be a little patient. My skin feels well hydrated and plump after it settles and looks really smooth and my pores aren't as obvious. It sits just fine under makeup for me but I'm not a new user to chemical exfoliants so I don't have lots of dead skin pilling up or sloughing off when I use it, my skin is, for the most part, already very smooth outside the acne and CCs. Occasionally I'll apply it further down my neck/decolletage than usual and WOW do I old skin just ball up and peel right away - it's so gross but also satisfying. So those that don't exfoliate often or are new to BHA/AHAs will likely have issues with foundation until their skin adjusts (but it will adjust). My advice in those cases is to either use this at night for the first few weeks or just accept going barefaced for a little while if you can.I'd strongly suggest not applying this product over anything that you feel does not dry down fully, the times I've attempted to use it after serums or heavier products it takes forever to sink in and sometimes never fully does. I save all my serums and essences for after this has absorbed and it's far easier to work with it as a result. My steps go like this most days: ACWell Licorice toner --- PC 2% BHA --- 10% Niacinamide serum --- TO Matryxil serum --- Secret Key Black Snail cream or Syn-ake cream w/ 3 drops Stratia Fortify oil --- Sunscreen.It works fairly quickly IMO, on my neck where I typically don't apply my Tret at night I noticed the peeling and balling of dead skin on day one and on my face where I have a patch of really awful CCs I noticed them getting smaller and smoother by around day 3-4. I'm going on about 8 days now and they're barely visible unless I'm right up in the mirror and feel as if they're almost gone when I touch my fingers to that area. I do have some slight peeling of the skin around my mouth and nose but it's not terrible (likely because I already exfoliate the heck out of my skin with the tret).Some tips and things keep in mind:1)DO NOT RINSE IT OFF. I don't understand some of the top reviews advising people to do that, it says on the bottle not to rinse and nearly all chemical exfoliators are meant to be left on until the next cleansing specifically so they can do their job. If you rinse it off you're either going to prevent it from properly exfoliating or end up irritating the hell out of your skin. If you have oily skin and feel this might be heavy on you than you can probably just use this on bare skin and  then sunscreen if you use in the AM or a lightweight lotion/cream and be done with it, but you need to leave it on your skin.2)You have got to use sunscreen while you're using this product! Any BHA or AHA exfoliant causes increased sun sensitivity and you have to address that in your routine. You should already use sunscreen daily but it becomes a must when you incorporate a chemical exfoliator or you risk sun damage.3)Less is more! Don't slop this on your face or soak a cotton pad in it, a little goes a long way and you'll be kicking yourself if you apply way too much and have to wait 20+ minutes for it to sink in. Use a shake or two and add more if needed but go easy.4)Expect some irritation initially. Chemical exfoliants can be harsh and rough even on sturdy skin and you have to give yourself time to adjust. Over-exfoliation is a possibility but sometimes just introducing a BHA or AHA into your routine can cause some sensitivity. Don't panic and just be gentle to your skin. Use ceramides (like Cerave Skin Renewing cream) or fatty oils to soothe your face if needed and try to stay away from any harsh products or acids like Vitamin C right after applying this to avoid really burning your face."
"The lady that does my hair told me about this product, she did me a great big favor. She told me to put it on my face after I wash it, applying it to where I have large pores, my nose. Within just days the poor started to shrink and now they look wonderful. I highly recommend this and I just bought a second bottle for the downstairs bathroom. I like to use exfoliating facial wipes in the morning to clean my face and then I apply this product with either my finger, q-tip or cotton rounds. So if you have large pores I would suggest you get a bottle of this, it will clean them out and shrink them."
"I’ve been using the Paula’s Choice SKIN PERFECTING 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant for a few weeks now, and wow—this stuff is legit! My skin has never looked this smooth. I struggle with blackheads, enlarged pores, and the occasional fine lines, but this exfoliant handles it all.After just a few uses, I noticed my pores looked smaller, and the stubborn blackheads on my nose started to clear up. My skin feels softer and more balanced—no more oily T-zone by midday. Plus, it’s gentle enough that I haven’t experienced any redness or irritation, which is a big win since I have somewhat sensitive skin.I apply it every other night after cleansing, and it absorbs quickly without feeling sticky. A little goes a long way, so the bottle will definitely last! If you’re on the fence, trust me—this product is worth every penny.Pro tip: Follow up with a good moisturizer and sunscreen during the day because this stuff really gets your skin working!"
"Been using this for a while and within days i felt like i was seeing results. It dried my skin after use but i applied face cream to help. I saw some very gentle peeling after some time so i knew it was working, my face just felt and looked more even toned, firm and clean"
"I’ve tried everything and nothing can match this.It’s a little oily like others have mentioned but I apply with a cotton round then I rub in with my hands.. this gets it deeper into the skin.  Does not burn and not a terrible smell.  Has reduced pores and reduced reddish tones on my cheeks.  I do not use daily but I do use it 3 times a week., at night.  I wouldn’t Recommend in the morning or using under makeup.  After I apply and rub it in I let it sit for about 30 min then I apply my good nighttime cream. Skip your serums when using this it will just cancele them out especially vit C.  Highly recommend to anyone wanting to shrink pores and even out skin tones/oils!  couldn’t live without it!"
This stuff has been a game changer for my skin. After I’d say 7-10 days my skin is totally glowing. It doesn’t burn or tingle but I’m used to acids on my face. It does have a slight odor but to be expected and doesn’t both me at all. I would recommend working up to daily because it can dry your skin out but it’s definitely a staple in my night time routine.
"I’m going to be honest with you I did not look at the size of the bottle before I bought it so when it came as a teeny tiny travel size for like the price of a full size I was a little taken aback but I used it anyway. I have no idea what it does. I can’t tell the difference. I was confused that it was a liquid exfoliate and that you didn’t need water to use it, but I’m not a skin care guru so I have no idea. I did get it in my mouth once and it was disgusting but I keep using it and it’s not doing anything bad so that’s a plus."
"I bought this and the BHA 9 spot treatment for sebaceous gland bumps on my face. I honestly can't tell if it works. I've been using it for over a year. They aren't getting bigger, but not shrinking. I keep using it since I don't know if this is helping slow down the bumps from getting bigger. I would not waste the money if you're looking for help with blackheads or milias. If it wasn't for the sebaceous glands and hoping it's preventing them from getting larger, I wouldn't waste the money."
"La cantidad es bastante, hace meses que lo pedí y aun tengo la mitad aprox. Lo uso en rostro de 1 a 2 veces por semana. También lo aplique en codos y manos para suavizar y funciono de maravilla. Si se nota el cambio en la piel, no irrita, la calidad vale la pena el precio mil veces. Aplico pomada aquaphor como mascarilla después del exfoliante y mi piel amanece divina"
This leaves my skin feeling very clean & soft without drying it out.
"Muy bueno he notado cambios en piel, incluso han disminuido los puntos negros en mi nariz."

"This is my first ever chemical exfoliant. I've used a BHA product in the past, but I didn't find it did anything substantial to my skin and thus, never really thought to go back to it. However, this product came highly recommended and I decided to give it a shot.Note about my skin: I tend toward dry skin that can be pimple-prone in the chin (and more recently neck!) area. I have enlarged pores on my nose and occasionally on my cheeks. My skin is also uneven and I have brown spots from prior cystic acne. I picked up this product to, thus, help with the occasional pimple, enlarged pores, and unevenness in skin tone. My husband also shares this product with me, though he has oily skin and his problem is enlarged pores around the nose and cheeks with the occasional pimple in these areas.Because my skin is on the drier side and I use a physical exfoliant around three times a week, I use this product max twice a week on the days I would use a hydrating cleanser. Application is about a nickel-sized amount on my fingers that I then rub in. I've used it for about two months at this point.I will say this product, even with minimal use, helped with my skin texture. Before my skin tended to feel very dull and I've noticed a difference. My brown spots have not changed since using, but I also didn't expect any change since I use the product so infrequently and haven't used it for long.Prior to using this BHA formulation, my pimples were frequent - probably having a new one once the last one healed. Initial use didn't eradicate the pimples, but it sped up the healing process substantially. I don't think I've had a new pimple now for the past month.My skin is generally fine after using, though it will feel dry if I don't put on a moisturising cream right away (I tend to wait 30 minutes after application to be sure the BHAs have time to do their thing). However, this isn't out of the ordinary for me in general even when I gently cleanse.I can't say I've noticed a difference in pore size, but I'm willing to keep using it given the other pros. I'd also like to see if this will become more noticeable with prolonged use.As for my husband, who uses it as frequently as I do, it has helped with skin tone as well as keeping pimples at bay. Once again, no big difference in pore size.Overall, definitely a great BHA product if you're in the market for one (and have the funds to buy it). If you have the occasional pimple that seems to take forever to heal and your skin feels very dull in general, I'd definitely say try this product out. If you have dry skin, it would be a good idea to build up usage in case it really irritates your skin. If you're only looking to use it for enlarged pores, I personally have not noticed a difference, but I also only use it once a week and I've only used it for two months. Take that as you will."
"I honestly thought this was a body wash of some sort, some kind of scrub, but what it really is and the only way to describe it is that I used to work for a company We would have to change the oil and do a lot of car related things where your hands and your face would get dirty and regular soap would not get the dirt off. They had at the car place and I don’t remember the name of it some kind of soap that was Almost like a hard powder. But when you wash your face and hands with it, all that dirt came right off. That Is basically what this is. Again, I thought it was something else, but I gave it five stars because if I’m doing projects and I get that kind of dirt on me rather than wash my hands 15 times I can wash my hands with this and they come clean and they smell great. So my honest review would be this was not the reason why I bought it Initially, But it ended up being useful in a completely different way and I’m very happy with that. So for the reason that I gave, I would recommend it. If you’re looking for a body wash, I would not recommend it"
"I can not stress enough how absolutely fantastic and useful this product is! I'm currently using Vanilla Shea Sugar Scrub! I've used several other scents in the past including, Pineapple, Watermelon and Coco Colada which are only a few of the many scents Tree Hut offers but so far Vanilla is my favorite. When I'm standing under my rainforest shower head and I twist top off of my Tree Hut Scrub I feel like I in the center of a vanilla bean field! Yes, it's that delicious! And let's talk about how effective it is as a scrub. After I scrub my knees, elbows and heels my skin feels like a baby's bottom. Unbelievablely soft and smooth. I would recommend using a small amount and testing it first on areas that are prown to have sensitive skin such as your belly and your inner thighs. Start with a tiny bit on your rag or loofah, you can always add more. And after your shower and go about your day I'm willing to bet people will be telling you how good you smell and asking you what perfume your wearing! It truly is that good! Enjoy your scent-sational day!!"
"This hibiscus smells amazing! I love the way this smells, I use these when I give pedicures and everyone always says how good it smells. Even if you are not a flower person, the smell of this is very soft. I got mine while it was on a decent sale and I don't regret it. I loved it so much that I actually would buy it full price. I definitely think if you are looking for a good smelling exfoliant, this is the one. It has a lot of grit feel to it, so it does get all that dead skin off. The only negative thing that I would say is that it leaves a sticky residue on your skin, if you miss a spot while rinsing it off. I suggest using a wet rag to wipe off everything when you are done."
"I've been looking for body scrub for a while and decided to give this a shot. For the smell, it's closer to cotton candy to me than rose but I don't mind.  For the scrubbing function, skin feels very smooth after use.  Going to try it for longer and hopefully the skin will feel smoother and moisturized for longer term."
absolutely love the product the smell is fabulous while you're in the shower after that there's nothing which is surprising because I have the watermelon and I have the pineapple and both of those you walk out of the bathroom and you can smell it in the next room that's how potent they are granted they don't stay on your skin very long but as far as using them as a scrub they're fabulous I mean your skin feels fabulous afterwards and smooth and it doesn't prevent you from having to use moisturizer you still do I do like the fact that they're not oil-based so it's gentler on your shower system and turn your drainage etc for having oils go down there to clog it up you could possibly add your own oil to it if you wanted to maybe move it up a little bit out a little argan oil to it a couple drops and mix it in there I'm sure it would work but it's fine just as it is and so far as I said the peach is the only one that I adore peach it smells great in the shower it just there's no fragrance afterwards whatsoever so that's disappointing I also have the vanilla which I have not yet used so we'll see how that is but the watermelon so far by far and the pineapple are both fantastic I mean the watermelon is absolutely incredible so you don't smell like watermelon afterwards I mean your your house smells over for a little while but but you don't and it definitely a value for the money because it's really unsubscribe and save I mean these little jars last well over a month using them every other day so you're getting at least 15 probably to 20 uses out of each jar so I would say it easily would last a month and that's using a lot so you could cut it back and you could probably get a full month out of each jar easily
"This product is amazing! The smoothness of it is amazing, and it makes your skin extremely soft. The product is a little thick so a little goes a long way. The smell is beautiful. It has a long lasting gorgeous smell. You can put this product anywhere on your body. I defiantly recommend!!❤️"
"The beauty of the containers is what attracted me to buy this sugar scrub. However, after I opened the container to assess the scent, I was taken away to a tropical land. Omg, the smells are amazing. I then used them and passed them to my daughter and we are both obsessed. The scents, colors, softness created, and price make these a go to self care item. These make an amazing gift for preteens through adults! I've yet to meet anyone say anything but I'M OBSESSED about this product."
"Love with first used!  I want the perfume with this smell and gel wash and mist. And everything that has a smell. Powder, rinse aid and even liquids for washing floors, hand soap. THIS IS THE SMELL OF MY DREAMS!!!"
I really like this smell and the scrub is wonderful. I reordered 3 of these.
Goood
"El aroma es muy ligero y no dura en la aplicación pero su función es muy buena deja el cuerpo fresco liso y no se si radiante sea la palabra pero si se ve el resultado, el grano es fino la consistencia es un poco solida pero al empezar a aplicarlo se va disolviendo y facilita la exfoliación."
Very nice smell.
Es un excelente producto. Olor muy rico deja suavecita la piel y aquí en Amazon está a muy buen precio.
"I’ve had KP bumps on my upper arms since I was a kid, I’ve tried so many different scrubs and creams for it. I noticed a difference after just one use of this product, and after a few weeks of using it the difference is incredible! My arms are so smooth for the first time ever, and it’s even helped the redness a bit.I also used this on my bikini line and it helps with razor burn too!"
"I wish I had thought to take before/after photos of the KP I've dealt with on my thighs for most of my life. I have tried several other (and, in many cases, more expensive) products that claim to specifically combat KP over the years. Some of them even include many of the same ingredients as FAB's KP eraser scrub. Many exfoliants or acid acne treatments have similar components as well. I have to tell you, though: I never, not even once, noticed any positive change or results from using other products that claimed the same target.** Please note that KP is not the same thing as enlarged pores, folliculitis, razor bumps, dry/itchy winter skin, or body acne; eczema, psoriasis, allergies, and infections (fungal types or ingrown hairs can become infected) can overlap, exacerbate, or mimic symptoms and appearance, but KP is it's own thing, usually genetic, that causes excess keratin to build up around and sometimes block a hair follicle. You may see some improvement or not if you have another condition and are using this to help. If you have a chronic skin condition of any kind, see a dermatologist or other expert to know for certain what you're dealing with, before attempting to treat your skin. **My KP was much worse in my youth on my extremely fair skin. I resigned myself early in life to never really showing my legs unless forced. Now that I've tried this, I actually stand a chance of wanting to wear a pair of shorts one of these days and not feel nearly as self-conscious. I noticed an immediate difference in the texture of my skin and the reduction of my more troubling KP bumps where the keratin plug/hair follicle was particularly noticeable or pigmented and raised. FIRST USE RESULTS. And I'm not so easily impressed, but I've been loving it more and more as time goes by, so it wasn't simply honeymoon phase.The exfoliant has what I can only describe as a gritty, almost cement-like texture and appearance straight from the tube, a little stiffer than toothpaste and salt mixed together, less granular than sugar scrubs to me. You don't need a lot of it even for large problem areas -- it has good mileage/coverage -- and you don't really need to scrub to death (in fact, not recommended; this buffs away what needs to go and includes pumice bits so you don't necessarily need a pumice stone or anything). I use it on the areas in question or affected and nowhere else -- I have body washes and other such stuff for the rest of my body... This is made for KP and that's what I target.The first time, I used maybe a half-inch amount on each inner thigh, spread it gently with my fingers, and then used my pumice stone in small light circles over the most troublesome areas. Since then, I've only been using my konjac sponge, and a little less product overall. I go through the rest of my shower routine making sure to wash it away properly but I don't use other exfoliants or scrubs on these areas. I have sensitive (redhead) skin and don't want to make it any more sensitive and prone to sunburn than it already is without the help of a vague chemical peel. Still, twenty minutes after showering, I can feel the areas tingling lightly, and that's how I know the magic is truly happening at the level it needs to be happening on. It doesn't burn, itch, or irritate at all, and doesn't leave any dryness or any build-up in it's wake. It also doesn't have any detectable smell. Even though I could still see the more irritated, raised KP bumps, the texture and feel was so remarkably different and reduced, I could hardly believe my fingers. For me, this is huge, because if I can FEEL the bumps, I'm prone to picking at the larger ones until I've gone from little keratin bumps to full bloody sores.Using this scrub about twice a week, for almost 2 months now, I'm amazed at the new texture of my troubled areas. I've even noticed an overall reduction in the development of new plugs which I thought would never be the case. Yes, I tried it once on a rough patch at my elbow and it smoothed it out, as any good exfoliant likely would, but I'm not wasting this miraculous stuff on anything but my KP bumps."
"I’ve had KP for forever, and I’ve always just tried to use lotion and it’s not rlly helped, btw I have KP on the backs on my arms a bit of my knees and legs. I’ve always been kinda insecure about this and tried apricot scrub, a wash cloth but nothing seemed to work sadly. I bought the 14oz I think or somewhere around that on prime day, and it was 100% worth it. Honestly you can size down on the bottle size bc I only used a pea size in the shower and that’s enough for me. The formula is super think and gritty, kinda like kinetic sand texture. After I used this, I obviously immediately felt my arms being softer, after 3-4 uses the redness went down quite a bit. I wish I had pictures, but the more I keep to use it the better it gets. It is a bit expensive but you only use a little bit so my bottle will last me a long time. I definitely want to try out other things from this brand!"
"Literally the best scrub I've used in my entire life. After moving to the US, the bumps and mini white spots on my arms got worse in the fall-winter time. I used AmLactin religiously and it was alright, but after 2 uses of this (2 times per week so after literally 4 days) my bumps were GONE yall."
"Purchased for reddened and rough, raised on my upper arms. This product has worked wonders. My arms are now super smooth and less red and I only use this product maybe 2 times a week. It is very exfoliating and rubs the rough patches away."
"I’ve been using this every couple of days for the past few weeks. Haven’t noticed a huge difference with the bumps on the back of my arms. It does have a nice texture and consistency and makes for a nice exfoliating scrub, but I haven’t seen the results. I was hoping for."
"I still have a few bumps on my chest but it has gotten rid of 75%,and that's only using it maybe five times. And it makes your skin smooth. Will buy again when I run out for sure."
Used it a few times now and I can tell the difference right away. The little bumps on my arms are smoother now and also the redness lessened.
Lo compré para mis brazos y con 2 veces que lo he usado (con una semana de diferencia) ya noto una gran mejoría. Lo recomiendo sin duda.
Significant improvements
Très bon gommage. Pas d'odeur particulière. Grains assez fins mais fait très bien son effet sur la peau et en douceur. Pas agressif pour les peau sensibles.
"Ha microgranuli finisismi, ne basta anche poco e lo si massaggia sulla pelle umida senza avere la sensazione di doloroso sfregamento che danno scrub più spessi; allo stesso tempo il risultato è persino migliore, pelle esfoliata morbida e idratata senza fastidioso senso di unto che danno alcuni scrub con oli, personalmente non mi piacciono, questo invece è eccezionale per me!"
"El mejor exfoliante corporal que he probado, deja la piel espectacular. Lo uso en la ducha con la piel húmeda voy frotando y luego lo dejo antes de aclarar actuar unos minutos ya que lleva ácidos exfoliantes.Resultado piel de bebé y cero irritación"
"This is the second one of these that I have bought. (The first is probably stuck in a drawer on a cruise ship.) The important part of the instructions is to stroke in straight lines in the opposite direction of hair growth. Once you get used to the feel of it and your skin has started to smooth, you can switch to circular motion and longer sessions.I user this before epilatiion with the Braun Silk-epil 9 Flex (ASIN: B07ZHZJ4X8). It's compact, effective and easy to maintain."
"This worked great on my ingrown hairs! I felt immediate relief from the itching and loved it.  I have scalp psoriasis and have to be very gentle on my skull, that thing will devour your melon if you go at it to hard!"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this brush! It's a little on the painful side, but the results are worth it.I get really bad ingrown hairs on my legs after shaving. It had gotten the point where it was ridiculous. Even with a good exfoliation & shave cream, I still got ingrown hairs. It's like the leg hair grows back *just* under the skin, which then itch like crazy. All it takes is one absent-minded scratch to inflame them, and then I've got red, itchy bumps all over my legs.So I ordered this in desperation, hoping it would help. And to my surprise, it actually did. With the first use I got a smoother shave then I've ever gotten on my legs, and my skin was much softer. I've used it every other day now for a week, and the itchy bumps are almost completely gone. I still have some ingrown hairs, but it's nothing like what it was, and my legs are getting a little better each time I use it.Just FYI - the directions don't say to do so, but it helps to use shower gel. Just a little bit of lather seems to help it glide better.My *only* complaint is that it is almost too painful to use, particularly on sensitive skin. It's okay for my lower legs, but anything above the knee hurts. It's just too harsh for sensitive areas, even with the lightest touch. Honestly it makes me cringe. The backs of my legs are agony, and it was just as bad under the arms. Unfortunately the backs of my legs are the worst for ingrown hairs, so I've been gritting my teeth and powering through it, but MAN does it hurt!Worth it, though, to get rid of the itchy bumps.**I'm fed up with fake reviews, so just FYI - this is a real review, by a real person, who really did pay $10.97 for this brush and who has actually used it!**"
This is exactly what I was looking for and a great value! There was absolutely no smell! The firmness of the brush is not too rough nor is too soft and works well on the skin without being too harsh! The way the handle is shaped it is easy to grip no matter if you plan to use it wet or dry!
You have to be careful because it can hurt if you have sensitive skin. It’s a good exfoliation but it’s a bit rough
"Like many, I thought there was no way this would work. First time using it and the back of my legs were smooth!!!wish I would have found this sooner. Having the little bumps always bothered me and now they are finally gone!!!"
I used this today for the first time. It isn’t too rough which is great. I was able to use on my neck and body and i never have had such a smooth shave. A significant different in looks already!
I used this once in the shower. The bristles were hard but work good for exfoliating. I dropped it by accident as it gets slippery due to the handle being plastic mixed with the soap made it hard to hold onto. After dropping it I noticed it has a crack in it and water is inside of the brush. It seemed to have trapped water/soap between the handle and the bristles. I hoped the crack in it would at least allow the water to drain out. Two days after I checked it and there is still water trapped inside. This bothers me after only one use. I can’t imagine after multiple uses how much water and build up would accumulate. I went ahead and ordered the wooden brush instead as I won’t be returning this after using it and thought I’d let others know. Other than the water issue and the slippery handle my only other concern is how rough the plastic bristles are and what it would do to your skin over time. Just seems a little harsh. The instructions say “use lightly on skin until you get use to it”. For $10 after taxes seems too much for what you get.
Sanitary and easy to hold - much better than any other ive used - for those who say it's sore - it's not meant to be soft otherwise it's not doing the job it's meant for  - perhaps the pressure you're applying is incorrect - I recommend this product !
Thought I would use it just on my legs…..but I love it everywhere.
I ended up discarding the plastic parts and keeping the scrubber. I don't have time to be cleaning all the pieces after each use as water can get trapped inside and cause mold. Please sell the scrubber part on it's own!
It’s all good
"Llegó a tiempo mi producto, lo probé en seco y sentí que no funcionó tanto, pero cuando lo hice con la piel mojada sí sentí mejor mi piel :)"
"Works really well, especially when paired with the PanOxyl Acne Foaming Wash. Together, these two products have made a big difference in keeping my skin clear and my pores unclogged. It does tend to dry out the skin a bit, but with a good moisturizer, it balances out perfectly. If you're looking for a duo that effectively fights acne, this exfoliant along with the PanOxyl wash is a fantastic combo. Just be sure to keep your skin well-hydrated, and you'll love the results!"
"I dont know what magic is in this stuff but its been amazing.My skin is picky. If its not oily, its dry and peeling. Ive tried tons of products and usually the heavy duty stuff is all that works at the cost of peeling skin.I paired this with their face wash and nightly moisturizer and I havent been this happy with my skin in a long time. The images are a month apart. My skin is less oily, and i can use the exfoliant even alone on days where i dont have time for a full wash."
Only been using for 2 weeks.  I'm in my 50s with larger Pores and uneven skintone.  This is not overdrying and my skin is smoother than it's been in years.  Buying more at this great ptice
Aun no lo he usado por mucho tiempo pero puedo ver un pequeño cambio
"I have lots of blackhead on my nose. After I treat it with the oil, I use this item on the affected area. Works great.Make sure to use moisturizer or egf cream afterwards otherwise your skin will get super dry."
"I saw a difference within 2 days, where my skin had issues."
Es una excelente opción por el de Paula Choice más cantidad por un precio adquesible y buena calidad.
Seems okay.  Use to keep skin coear if breakouts.

"I have had microdermabrasion done at spas before.  Some use a scrub that feels like sandpaper and others use something that you would hardly notice.  This isn't like sandpaper but you do notice that you have something 'gritty' rubbing your skin.As I get older, the less abrasive stuff I want to use on my face.  I have enough problems without making my face red from having it rubbed with sandpaper.  This is very easy to use, low odor and not very abrasive.  I know that I am using something rougher than just a foam cleanser but after I am done, my face is still intact with no red or angry looking areas.  That is a plus."
I have sensitive acne prone skin.  I've been using it every other day for about two weeks.  I love it!!!!!! My skin looks amazing in the morning.  Do this at night as you might get pretty red.  The scrub is very very fine which I love.  Not too abrasive either
"Cream type base and essentially all scrubber particles. Particles are very fine. A little goes a long way. Use to help peel off dead skin from Retin-a use. Leaves my skin tight, shiny and glowing. I don’t know the quality of the cream the “scrub” is suspended in but as far as the exfoliating quality it’s as good or better than any of the very expensive scrubs and I rarely have found a scrubbing exfoliation product that is as dense as this one. Highly recommend."
"this product exfoliates super well! my only complaint is that it has a really strong fragrance, and i tend to avoid putting perfumey things on my face, but other than that it really works"
"I really like the DRMTLGY brand. After years of struggling with skin issues and trying to find a product that didn’t enhance my pores or make my skin too oily, I finally learned that I needed to be on the search for a good facial scrub (esthetician recommended) I came across this brand that seemed to have a lot of the ingredients we talked about for sensitive skin! Reviews were great, so I purchased. This is something you should only use 2-3 times a week, but I use it maybe once every 2 weeks (only pea sized amount). You notice a difference in skin texture, tone and vibrancy immediately after use! The only downfall to this product is that it leaves a film like texture for around 48hrs (for me at least). When I go to apply my makeup the next morning, I have noticed my foundation does not adhere to my face as usual and gives it a “cakey” look. I also experience this same issue after I get professional facials, so it may be certain products that don’t mix well.All in all, it’s a great scrub! This Microdermabrasion gives your skin a glowing/clean feeling as it uses the fine grit exfoliation to free any dirt and oil that may be lingering on your face after a long day.Jump in the shower for better effects (warm water opens pores), scrub well all over face, then gentle rinse and pat. It’s well worth the cost to give it a try (especially if you have sensitive skin like me)"
I was buying something similar that cost three times as much. My face feels amazing!!
This is my favorite face product! It works well! My face feels so soft afterwards.
"I was excited to try this new face scrub by DRMTLGY. Then I opened the jar and it wasn't full of product. I was really disappointed. I guess it's true, you have to be careful on what you buy, but I'm still going to try it."
"This is the best microdermabrasion you can ever buy . The quality is so fine and thin that it exfoliates excellent , it does sting if you scrub roughly and may irritate skin , but it left my skin so tight and smooth as if I got a professional grade facial."
I have a really sensitive skin and this is perfect! Real sandscrapper on my face and I don't turn into a lobster! Only a little amount is needed and my skin feels amazing!
I like the fact that you can feel the emulsion. Its gentle. I have sensitive skin and ive had no issues. A little goes a long way
Will definitely be purchasing again. Love the tiny pumice in the exfoliant. Works great.
"This has helped my skin so much! I have super sensitive skin and also a mix between too dry and too oily. This has helped with my black heads in two applications. I have super sensitive skin and it hadn't bothered me. I do have some redness after use, but that's normal for being a dermal abrasion. It gets all the dead skin off and clears black heads in a couple of days. I do use a hylaronic serum after application to cure any dryness and redness after. It works amazing together."
Omg this scurb is the ultimate bomb (in a good way). It's not too harsh it's smooth on the skin. It smells absolutely amazing and I can't wait to get more. 10/10. I've always love Dove products and when I buy them I feel like I get quality 😌 ☺️
I love this and it smells so great. Yes it's not sealed but thats how it comes. Its not used either the scrub just slides to whichever side it is laying on while being shipped. It's very good for the price.
"Fight scaling skin with this product.  Perfect to restore skin to a soft, silky texture.  Love it."
I like this product it does the job & smells nice
This is my second one of this that I already bought and I love it.
It smells good and is the best thing for your body feels good
Smells really good not too coarse and suds well. Will be buying other scents
I normally don’t like fragrance in skincare products because they either give me headaches or are simply not appetizing. Dove has some of the best-smelling skincare I know. This is one of the best! I love the milkyness of this scrub and like to use it on my feet where mechanical exfoliation is not too harsh on the skin. It washes of super easily and doesn’t leave any graininess behind. I cannot get over the smell. I regret not buying more during prime day when they were half the price!!!
"Its lovely effective scrub which cleans your body leaving you with so nice fragrance. It removes dead cells, skin becomes soft n breathing 👌👌👌"
"This smells so good and leaves the skin ultra-soft. This is now a favorite and I would buy this again before I run out. There is no need to use it every day, and twice a week is good enough. I haven't tried cheaper versions of this line, but this one is really good. Definitely worth buying."
Really like it
smells so good
Nice
"So, I recently had to change skin care brands because my skin is weird and after a time of using a brand my skin will start to react badly to it. Well, I had been using e.l.f for about 3 or 4 years. It worked great and I loved it! But then my skin said ""NOPE"" and started to break out when I would use my e.l.f skincare, so I knew it was time to switch. I truly loved my e.l.f skincare, so I was pretty bummed that I was going to have to find a new brand. So began the, reluctant, hunt. The hunt for a skincare brand that wouldn't mess up my already sensitive skin and make it worse. Welcome to my life...🙄I've tried SO many brands over the years, so I already know a large portion of the main ones have too many additives and junk chemicals in them that just don't agree with my skin. I knew I had to find something new. I read a ton of online articles from all sorts of different magazines, and media sources and it was the same brands on almost all of them...the ones my skin doesn't like. Except for one...and I honestly don't even remember what the name of the magazine, or whatever, was now. But it talked about this brand Good Molecules, and how it had only the absolutely necessary ingredients in it to make the products work. Well, that got my attention. Then it talked about this one product from them that was great for ingrown hairs on the face and neck (which I suffer from thanks to PCOS). And it supposedly didn't cost an arm and a leg (which most ingrown hair products for the face do)! After actually seeing the price I was hesitant...to say the least. I mean how could such a cheap product really work? Well...it does! IT GENUINELY DOES! I was blown away within the fist two weeks of use!I use this product only at night and then I only use it every other night. I'm not exaggerating when I say this one product made a huge difference in my ingrown hairs. Do I still get them? Yes. But I also don't get near as many as I did, because, since I started using this overnight exfoliater, a large number of the hairs don't have dead skin to get stuck under anymore. They actually stick out of the skin enough to where I can pluck the painful ones and shave the rest (PCOS sucks y'all).I loved their overnight exfoliating serum so much, I bought more of their products. My new skincare brand is now Good Molecules. And my skin looks better and better the longer I use it. I now have their clarify & cleanse face and body wash bar (because I get acne on the back of my legs and my bum, which the bar has helped clear up a ton!), the glycolic exfoliating toner, the niacinamide serum, the overnight exfoliating serum (of course), the BHA clarify gel cream, and the lightweight daily moisturizer. I love them all, and I plan to purchase even more of their products! I bought all of them at the same time, (except the overnight exfoliating serum because I already had that) and it only cost me a little over $40!I'm so pleased with this brand! They've made great skincare accessible to everyone, not just the rich! I'm a teacher y'all, I can't afford to spend $30-$100 on ONE skincare product!! Good Molecules' products work, and they don't have a bunch of unnecessary ingredients and chemicals in them like the big name skincare brands do. Not to mention the fact that my skin looks A LOT better since I started using the Good Molecules brand! I don't plan on switching brands anytime soon. I'll keep using Good Molecules until my skin decides to say ""NOPE"" again. They're absolutely worth the price!"
"I shied away from glycolic acid and stronger AHAs for a long time because I wrecked my skin barrier with them before. However, I decided to try using this 1-2x a week to replace my other AHA products (a lactic acid cream I was using every other night in alternation with a BHA exfoliant, and the famous red peel mask, weekly) in an effort to streamline my routine. I find that it is quite effective at smoothing and resurfacing my complexion, and doesn’t strip my skin as long as I use it carefully and in moderation - no more than every 3 nights max. I don’t find a need to incorporate any other AHA products into my routine anymore. It tingles a little bit upon first application, but it fades quickly. Make sure you have a healthy skin barrier before you use this product, and just ease into it. I think it’s really helping my skin stay clear as part of a well-rounded skincare regimen :)"
This product works. I was using the discoloration serum to fade out my dark spots and then I tried this. I love the fact that I only need to use a few dots. It's not sticky. There's little to no smell at all. It made my face feel like a baby's butt. Smoothhhhhhhhhh. Love it.
There this tingling sensation after use …I don’t know if it’s normal or not…But I always wake up to a glasslike looking face…which I absolutely love ❤️
"This brand Change my life, now I use all of their products for my skincare, it has worked a lot for me, i'm triathlete so Im exposed to the sun, so following the instructions I have not any problems."
"This is a strong exfoliant.  I use it 1-2x a week when I am not using retin A.  I feel like my skin feels better the next morning, but it is not super gentle on the skin. (probably because I use retin A daily).  I also use it on my neck and chest and haven't had a bad reaction.Great brand and price point."
"I’ve used other Good Molecules products before and had high expectations for this one. However, each time I use this product, it burns my face and makes my cheeks red. I ensure that each product going on my face doesn’t counteract, yet no matter what I do it burns my skin.As for exfoliation, I cannot speak much for that, seeing as I have stopped using this product."
These two have been doing wonders for my skin. I've recommended them to so many persons.
"My husbands back always has extra skin. After a bath if you run your nails over his back you get some pretty nasty stuff. I bought this for him only to be traumatized by how much dead skin was actually on his body. We live in Texas and it was like we left the bathroom window open during a winter snow storm. This was the most satisfying disgusting experience I've ever had.I was equally traumatized when I used it later and it looked like I spent my entire life growing up wanting to be a shedding snake. Ew.Feel so much cleaner. 😂 Gross experience, amazing product when used correctly. A negative review had that it didn't lather soap, don't put soap on it. It's not meant for that. Just soak yourself and scrub. We didn't even have to get the glove wet, the residual bath water on our skin was enough.10/10 does it's job. No issues with tearing for ours. Doesn't hurt at all, no skin agitation. Just clean, refreshed and a new part of our normal hygiene care."
Does exactly as it’s supposed to. I’ve used this now 4 times. It takes a minute to figure out the proper balance of moisture. Here’s what I have learned:-MUST soak body (shower or bath) for approx 15-20 min. This loosens the dead skin.-Must towel dry off leaving the slightest amount of dampness on the skin. Stay in the shower!-Only add just a couple of DROPS of water to the mitt-flip the mitt on ver from side to side during use.-circles are not necessary but stay in one spot for a bit before moving in after skin releases.ENJOY THE SOFTEST SKIN OF YOUR LIFE
One of my favorite exfoliators. I use a lot of different products and have tried lots more but this is the easiest and most efficient exfoliator! Bought it three times and will continue to keep it in my skincare rotation!
You will be shocked at how much dead skin this thing removes from your body. The key is to soak in the tub first. It works great - I would give it ten stars if I could.
"I've been looking for creams to lighten between my thighs and more sensitive areas (booty) but have been too scared to make a purchase for fear of burning myself. I've been ""exfoliating"" with no improvement. I came across this body scrubbing mitt and saw the rave reviews so I figured I'd try it. Get it! I follow the instructions and stood in very warm water almost hot for 10 minutes, I didn't use any soap, I turned the shower off and squeezed the excess water out of the mitt and started exfoliating. I was careful since I wasn't sure what to expect but boy oh boy! It lightened between my legs, my butt, and left my skin so soft and healthy looking. Best purchase ever!!!"
"It is okay, have found out that there are many others out there that do the same thing perhaps you should look longer because there are many more that are a lot cheaper"
"Please don’t stop making this product! I don’t want to be dramatic, but it has been life changing! I have suffered from extremely dry skin all my life. No amount of moisturizing or exfoliating products corrected the issue. Avoided wearing dark clothes because of my flaky skin. This is the best product I have ever come across. I wish I had this product 40-50 years ago. I use it weekly and moisturize daily with great results."
"I use this product once a week while showering and it worked wonders. It left the skin smooth and soft, I would be gentle on the face as it can be a little rough, but overall great product. Highly recommend."
"This works amazingly well. Read the instructions as NO SOAP, just water.  I soaked for a good 15 minutes then exfoliated and OMG does it ever work well!  So much so that I kept feeling up my legs after it was done, they were so smooth, and without lotion!I also bought the back one and I would say every woman should have one, it works so amazingly well.  My best friend and both daughters are getting a set for Christmas.  Great gift for a woman & easily 5 stars."
Muy bueno como exfoliante
"I saw this online , someone reviewed it and I tried it out and the results were great . I will definitely buy it again it’s in my cart to buy again"
The product is too Harsh on the skin and no effets observed as mentioned on website
"Très bonne qualité. Un peu cher, on verra si il résiste au fil des utilisations"
"I tend to hate most exfoliants. Whenever I use a chemical exfoliant I feel like I never get the results I want and it does nothing for my face. So, I prefer physical exfoliants. However, a lot of them are really harsh on the skin or make me breakout. I decided to give this a try and my gosh. This is literally the best exfoliant I’ve ever had. I’ve used this for about a year now and wanted to share, I use this every week (2x) and it’s amazing. Would 10000% recommend."
"I LOVE this stuff! I am 59 slipping into 60. I like using a gentle exfoliator and this truly fits the bill. It leaves my skin so smooth, clean and bright. I don't use it every day, but you could. I get the small container because for me it lasts 6 months. I have slightly combination skin, with a couple of adult acne spots that pop up from time to time. This helps calm those down, but is not drying. I have been using this for about 5 years. I would absolutely recommend this product!!"
"I used to use this product many years ago. I came across a YouTube video that jogged my memory and decided to try it again. I have rosacea that is under control but I avoid harsh scrubs and chemicals. However, I needed a little something to help with unevenness and help my products work by removing dry skin. This did not disappoint! This was just what I needed to help boost the appearance of my skin. It’s easy to use and I can control the amount to accommodate my needs. I use it every other day, and I’m thrilled I rediscovered it!"
"I use this with my tretinoin which causes severe peeling of the skin, I also used this a few days after a microneedling session that caused my skin to peel really badly, it gently exfoliated my face to perfection leaving not a single dead skin cell behind. It also leaves your face extremely soft which is a nice bonus"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



I initially got the travel size to try this out because I wasn't sure how I'd like this product. I'm not big on chemical exfoliants because of how sensitive my skin is, but I needed something better than a konjac sponge to get my dead skin off without over-exfoliating and damaging my skin barrier (you'll know if that happens, you'll feel stinging and/or you'll get extremely dry patches of skin that aren't necessarily dead skin). This actually works for me. I don't necessarily do it every day, because I have a harsher physical exfoliant I use once or twice a week to get certain spots on my face and neck I know get really bad buildup, but on the other days this is amazing for the upkeep. As such, I bought the full-size and refill bundle so I'll be good for a long while.On a side note, I attached a video of something I found really funny with the packaging. There is an anti-tampering sticker on the top part of the box, but there is full, unadulterated access to the bottom of the box and no one would be the wiser (at least regarding the refill, since the main bottle is difficult to get out from the bottom). Someone from Dermalogica should prooooobably look into fixing that, since it kind of renders the ""anti-tampering"" sticker moot if you can just...flip the box over haha I am trying to think of how to refill my travel sized one mess-free for, well, travel, since according to online searches the company claims it should be refillable."
"really like this exfoliant. i usually use smth like paula’s choice 2%, but i wanted that physical exfoliating feeling, that leaves my face feeling just niceC and this does just that. it doesn’t smell a little funk, like rice smell, which makes sense. and using it takes a little practice to get the water to powder ratio just right. overall i will keep using it"
I love this product. It makes my face feel so clean and refreshed. When I’m done washing my face I have an illuminating glow. I get many compliments and asked what my skin care regimen is. Thank you Dermalogica.
This product is one of best exfoliator I've used been using for a while now and I keep repurchasing it because Great on my skin. My skin feels so clean without irration
"I had surgery on my face debride and the skin produces escessive dead skin build up, plus I'm allergic to tons of beauty products, I've used this product for years to get rid of the excessive dead skin build up I get from the scar tissue that my skin produces, and it works, I get smooth feeling skin, reduced blemishes etc..I's recommend it for everyone, reduce blemishes, blackheads, whiteheads, breakouts, dead skin buildup. IT WORKS>"
"This is the best face product I use. It was given to me as a gift for the first time over 20 years ago, and I continue to use it regularly. I get it as a gift often because I love it. It is such a good quality powder that takes off all the dead skin on the face and neck. I don't have to use it daily but more 4 times a week. Hands down it beats all other face cleansers."
"El envío súper rápido, me llegó súper rápido. Estoy fascinada con el producto, al ser en polvo se puede controlar mejor la porción a utilizar, con unas gotas de agua de inmediato hace espuma y se limpia con facilidad la cara.Tengo una semana utilizándolo y me deja la piel limpia y suave, se ha vuelto uno de mis productos favoritos 😁"
"I had tried this product years ago and hadn't quite appreciated how gentle it is on sensitive skin - just rebought it and very pleased with the results! I have very sensitive skin (dermographism and eczema flare ups), and get dry patches around the chin and cheek area when stressed. I use a pea-size amount of powder, mix it with a few drops of warm water, wash my face and then immediately apply moisturiser. Magic!"
"Used sparingly with facial cleanser, I can feel the difference for smoothness on skin.  Use 1/2 teaspoon on palm and add creamy facial cleaner."
"Love these brushes! I use them alternately and not only is my skin silky soft, but I like how invigorated I feel after the massage. I wash them afterwards, as indicated, and hang them to dry."
"Nice brushes for exfoliating. As I am aging my skin gets more dry and itchy, and these brushes definitely help. I keep one in the shower and the other in my bedroom so they are convenient and at hand. Well made, the bristles haven't loosened at all with months of use. Comfortable in my hand too, lots of room for larger hands as well."
"I love this product, it has helped me with exfoliation ever since I purchased it. It’s also very useful that it comes with adhesive to stick to the shower wall. The brushes are very durable and have two different levels of stiffness and firmness. I will warn the harder of the two can hurt if you scrub too hard. It’s easy to hold and is about the size of an adult woman’s palm. It is incredible, I recommend it!"
The dry brush I love and it’s really effective. Could see dry skin coming off.The wet brush doesn’t feel rough on the skin and goes well with my body scrub. I’ll buy new ones again in 2-3 months
works well. feels good. def seeing a difference in my thighs after using a few times
"I'm a 75 year old man and wanted to replace an existing bath/shower brush that's on its last legs.  I got these and used one during my next shower.  WOW.  The bristles were stiff and remained stiff through the shower.  I had to stop using it on my arms and upper body.  No way could I use it on my face or neck.  It worked great on my legs and feet but I noticed they were red and irritated after drying off.  I'll keep them but they're going on the kitchen and utility sinks to scrub hands (and other things) after working outside.Update 1 June 2023I'm an idiot.  Yes, ONE brush bristles are stiff, but the other brush is much softer.  I didn't read the description close enough and had put the brushes aside without checking both of them.  Now that I have used both brushes, one is much softer  than the other.  The softer brush is just fine and works well in the shower.  Perhaps in the future I'll pay more attention to the product description.  My bad.Changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars."
I used both in the shower the other night and was left with bristles all over my body from them falling out of the brush while using them. Not sure how long they will even last since it lost so many bristles. Will try to update in a month if they last that long.Update: Their customer service emailed and issued me a full refund and didn’t require me to return anything for it which was very unexpected and very much appreciated.
it is very easy to use and hold. it feels high quality and is a size that can easily be stored ( it even comes with a hook to hang it on).  i have not tried cleaning it but i imagine it would be difficult to clean.

"I absolutely love the CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment! This product has transformed my nighttime skincare routine. It goes on smoothly and feels so lightweight, and I love waking up to visibly smoother and more radiant skin. The gentle exfoliation is perfect for my sensitive skin — no irritation at all! I appreciate the blend of ingredients that nourish my skin while I sleep. It’s become an essential part of my regimen, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their skin’s texture and glow!"
"CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment: A Gentle Yet Effective Skincare SolutionIntroduction:The CeraVe Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment is a targeted skincare product designed to promote skin renewal and improve overall skin texture. Formulated with dermatologist-recommended ingredients, this exfoliating treatment aims to gently remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and reveal smoother, more radiant skin.Key Features:Gentle Exfoliation: The CeraVe Nightly Exfoliating Treatment features salicylic acid, a beta hydroxy acid (BHA), known for its ability to penetrate deep into the pores to dissolve oil and debris. This gentle exfoliation helps to unclog pores and promote cell turnover without causing irritation or redness.Moisture Retention: Unlike many exfoliating treatments that can leave the skin feeling dry and stripped, CeraVe incorporates hyaluronic acid into its formula. Hyaluronic acid is a hydrating ingredient that attracts moisture to the skin, helping to maintain hydration levels and prevent dryness.Barrier Support: CeraVe products are renowned for their inclusion of ceramides, essential lipids that help to restore and maintain the skin's natural barrier. The Skin Renewing Nightly Exfoliating Treatment contains ceramides to help reinforce the skin barrier, ensuring optimal moisture retention and protection against environmental aggressors.Non-comedogenic Formula: Ideal for all skin types, including sensitive and acne-prone skin, the CeraVe Nightly Exfoliating Treatment is non-comedogenic, meaning it won't clog pores or exacerbate acne. This makes it suitable for those with oily or combination skin who may be prone to breakouts."
"Wow, this stuff is amazing. Put it on at night and my skin feels so soft and refreshed in the morning. really like this stuff!"
"My skin looks terrible ever since I turned 40. Perimenopause has set in, and I’m getting hormonal breakouts all along my chin and jaw line. They’re hard, cystic, and stubborn to treat. I’ve seen people raving about lactic acid and niacinamide on social media, so I got this and the CeraVe moisturizing face wash. This stuff BURNS if you have any acne marks or abrasions, but by the next morning they’re healing!It’s extremely gentle. I used another product with lactic acid in it previously, but noticed a lot of drying and peeling after a few days. I haven’t experienced that with nightly use. My skin looks glowing, more radiant, FIRMER, and my tone is evening out. No changes to dark spots (yet). I have less bumps, no new breakouts, less redness, and more hydration. I’m using it alongside a peel by The Ordinary (the dark red one) and my skin hasn’t looked this good in years! Even though there’s added hydration, I still need to buy a simple, basic moisturizer; I’ll look at CereVe since my skin likes this.UPDATE: I took my skincare routine one step further and got a different cleanser. If you suffer from hormonal acne like me, try zinc soap (but look for Pyrithione Zinc, usually 1-2%). I got a bar of it on Amazon, and I swear these two products together have been life changing. Hello clear skin!!!Hope this helps. 😉"
Affordable and works great for my skin!
"I really like using this serum. In just 3 weeks I have noticed that my skin texture is smoother. I started using it every other day the first week, then every day after that. I just bought the Vit C serum by Cerave and will incorporate that into my morning routine."
"In the winter my face gets very dry and I started using this. I quickly noticed a difference. The lotion doesn’t smell the greatest, but it does magical things."
Esperaba más
Box of the product is damaged and has been retaped. There’s no expiry date as well so not sure if the product sent is also damaged and/or expired.
"Item arrived in a unpadded Amazon pouch with zero bubble wrap or packing peanuts, so no surprises the original box came crushed. I was actually shocked the bottle inside was still intact."
La caja venia en muy malas condiciones.
Requesting to mention manufacturing & expired date on the can
"As a teen, I used Buf-Puf to gently cleanse and exfoliate my acne-prone skin before applying Adult Acnomel cream  Today I use it to gently massage other gentle cleansers and moisturizers into my skin. I love it when people tell me how pretty (and wrinkle-free) my skin is, because I am in my 50s!!!"
I used a Buff Puff as a teenager and am returning to it as a 60+ woman.  Using it with my regular soap in the shower has left my skin brighter and happier!
The sponge is large and soft. I put a small amount of cleanser & it foamed up nicely on the sponge. Because the sponge is soft it felt gentle on my face. My face felt smooth and clean.  I would buy again.
It gets the job done. It’s an exfoliating sponge. I use it when I need it. Only thing is I wish it came with a case or something. It’s hard to keep it clean and store it so it doesn’t get moldy or have bacteria all over it.
"They were so popular back in my day, 70's.Wish they came in half that size and a package of 6."
It’s great!
"This facial scrubber is allot softer than I thought it would be.  I had used the battery scrubbers with brushes in the past, but this actually works better.  I’ve a scar on my face and have found that this item does not irritate it."
"So like ive been using it a little over 2 weeks ? Its soft on my sensitive skin, and exfoliates extremely good. Now i dont know if its the sponge or my products but i think it might be collecting dirt, and then when i wash my face with it i get MORE acne. Lately ive been breaking out and im so confused because my skincare products have helped me SM and its hard to believe they just stop working ?? So uhm now i have to stop using the sponge cus i have a feeling its that ."
"Uso a cada dois dias no rosto,cotovelo para remover peles ásperas e fazer uma limpeza profunda em resquícios de maquiagem"
buen producto
I  used this product for years . For some reason I got away from them  but I'm back they clean and keep skin smooth as always. I like to use a facial cleanser with the Buff Puff for great results.
I use it for washing/ exfoliating my face. It seems hard wearing so far.
"Very happy with the product! But I only received 2 and not 3 as ordered. The third box was empty. I have been meaning to call but haven't had the time.Product 10, service 2!!"
"I’ve been using the Dove Scrub Macadamia & Rice Milk body scrub for many years, and I absolutely swear by it! This scrub has truly become a staple in my skincare routine, and I can’t imagine my showers without it.From the moment I first tried it, I fell in love with the creamy texture and the delightful scent. The combination of macadamia oil and rice milk is not only nourishing but also incredibly soothing for my skin. It gently exfoliates, leaving my skin feeling visibly smoother and softer after every use.What sets this scrub apart for me is how well it hydrates my skin. Unlike many scrubs that can leave your skin feeling dry and tight, this one leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I love how it brightens my skin and gives me that healthy glow.I also appreciate how easy it is to use. The scrub rinses off cleanly, and I don’t have to deal with any oily residue. It truly feels like a luxurious treat every time I use it.If you’re looking for a body scrub that delivers real results and feels amazing, I highly recommend the Dove Scrub Macadamia & Rice Milk. It’s been a reliable part of my skincare routine for years, and I can’t imagine going without it!"
"Alright, first disclaimer... I'm a guy. Second, I don't normally use these products. But it was on a crazy sale, and I felt.. why not. I've been trying to use better products for my skin lately that are less chemical and yet would not cost a fortune, so DOVE products became my go-to.I know it will sound weird for many dudes out there to... I don't know, dare I say it? Exfoliate? Ok, let's not repeat that... let's rephrase it as ""scrub the dust off our skin real hard"". That's better... and this is exactly what this does. I assume it's the little chunks of macadamia nuts in it, that scrubs the skin extremely well and gets the hard to get stains off your skin (think motor grease or whatever else).But here's the kicker and I'm not sure I'm helping my case here, but you'll smell like a cupcake! err.. a cookie? mmm... cake? I'm sorry guys, I know I'm not selling it here but it smells SO GOOD that you won't care if people laugh at you. I get hungry right after I take my shower and nearly need to eat baked goods right after. For me this is a ""night time"" sort of shower product as I would not be caught dead smelling like cake during the day. But in bed... yeah. Works."
This scrub is amazing! I make sure to use it at least once a week to get rid of tan and dead skin. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and the scent is just delightful!
Personally I love the smell of this one and it leaves my skin feeling extremely smooth and it's so easy to apply I usually use my hands and I can tell the difference When I use it VS when I don't
Best scrub hands down. I love the smell. It's a staple for my self care. I use it 3-4 times a week. I love it!
Love the smell of this. It also moisturizes your skin pretty well.
This product leaves my skin quite soft and smooth. It's my favorite go to body scrub. I use it regularly.
I’ve purchase this before. It smells great and it’s a great exfoliating without being too harsh
Me encantó el aroma y como deja la piel súper suave e hidratada
I struggled with so much body acne and using this twice a week really helped me. I still have body acne but it's reduced so much and it's because of the dove body scrub. It smells so so good and makes my skin soft after wash. I absolutely love this product ❤️
"So delicate I love it, it’s so fine not harsh at all! you can even use it everyday! Smells so good as well 💗"
"One bomb product this is. Ima huge fan of body scrubs, they just add that little bit of extra to make you feel refreshed... especially after wearing PPE kit for hours all together. Little bit goes long way, refreshing smell. Gonna buy the pomegranate variant too. Never stop manufacturing this! Only con - might feel a little harsh for people with sensitive skin, scrub slowly."
Looks good and smells nice but it is a gift so not tried. The item I received is different to the photo on listing as it doesn't say body polish it says body scrub but assume it is the same thing.
"I recently bought this 4-pack of Natural Loofah Sponges, and I’m really impressed with both the quality and performance. These loofahs offer an excellent exfoliating experience, and the fact that they are made with eco-friendly and biodegradable materials is a huge plus for me. They are perfect for anyone who wants to incorporate more sustainable products into their self-care routine.Great for ExfoliatingThese loofah sponges work wonders when it comes to exfoliating the skin. The natural texture is just the right balance between being effective at removing dead skin without feeling too harsh. After using them, my skin feels incredibly soft and smooth. They’ve been especially helpful in problem areas like elbows, knees, and heels where the skin tends to be rougher.Expands and Softens with WaterWhen you first receive the loofahs, they may appear stiff, but as soon as you soak them in warm water, they soften up and expand to a comfortable texture that’s perfect for scrubbing. I appreciate that they don’t feel too abrasive but still provide enough scrubbing power to leave my skin feeling rejuvenated.Eco-Friendly and BiodegradableOne of the best things about these loofah sponges is that they are made from natural, eco-friendly, and biodegradable materials. Knowing that these sponges won’t contribute to plastic waste once I’m done with them makes me feel better about my purchase. They are a great alternative to synthetic sponges, which often contain microplastics that can harm the environment.Perfect Size and Long-LastingEach loofah is the perfect size for use in the shower, and they feel durable. I’ve been using one loofah for a few weeks now, and it’s still holding up well. They also come in a 4-pack, which is great because I can use one and store the others for future use. Alternatively, you can use them for different purposes, like body exfoliation and scrubbing tougher surfaces like your feet.Suitable for Men and WomenBoth my partner and I use these loofahs, and they work well for both of us. The natural brown color and minimalistic design make them feel neutral and suitable for everyone, regardless of gender. They’re effective enough to satisfy the exfoliation needs of men while still being gentle enough for women.Easy to Use and MaintainUsing these loofahs is as simple as wetting them, applying your favorite soap or body wash, and scrubbing away. After use, they dry fairly quickly, which helps keep them hygienic and ready for the next use. I recommend hanging them up to air dry after every shower to ensure they last as long as possible.Final ThoughtsThe Natural Loofah Sponge Exfoliating 4-Pack is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a natural, eco-friendly exfoliation solution. They provide a satisfying scrub, leave the skin feeling soft and smooth, and are made from biodegradable materials, making them a sustainable choice. Plus, the 4-pack offers great value for the price. I highly recommend these loofahs to anyone looking to elevate their shower experience with a more environmentally conscious product."
This are not too soft and not too rough. Just the right amount to get a good scrub and exfoliate your skin.
"Overall a great product and worth it. My only suggestion to those looking to buy a loofah is to consider the softness. Personally, I feel like there are other products that do a better job at exfoliating. This product is a bit too soft for my overall liking. That is not a knock on this product, just personal preference."
"I like to use loofahs for their exfoliating property. Problem is not many stores carry them. Plugged loofa into the search bar on Amazon and had several to choose from. These work just fine, I'll be back when my initial purchase is exhausted."
"These loofahs are awkwardly large for a female hand and the textured side is quite thick and lumpy. It does exfoliate, though."
"Highly recommend.  Love the smaller oval shape, fits better in my hand than the rectangle.  Puffed right up when soaked in water for a few minutes.  My skin is now soft again using it, instead of dry and scaly.  Love the invigorating feel after using it in the shower."
I like the strap for holding.
"Great exfoliating but I needed more of a sponge type and this was too thin. Got the job done though, so there’s that! :)"
Love them!
La facilidad de uso y que el resultado es muy satisfactorio ya que realmente además de limpiar hace una exfoliación y te ayuda a relajarte
Fantastic and just the job for scrubbing the dead skin off
The loofah is great
Good quality and material
"I am 71 years old, and have been using this face scrub/mask for about two weeks. First of all, I don't have any major skin problems. I have been using all natural products on my face for the last couple of years, and noticed a couple of what looks like blackheads at the side of my nose. Whether this was caused by the oils I use on my face or just an aging thing, I don't know. At any rate, I decided it was time to look for a facial scrub, and chose this one because of the natural ingredients.As a facial scrub, I love it. The granules are small and not like rocks and the substance they are in applies easily and fluidly. The directions on the container recommend applying and leaving on your face for 1-3 minutes. Since I don't have a lot of spare time and am always in a hurry, I have managed to leave it on for 1 minute and have used it 3 times per week. I have noticed that the little blackheads around my nose are disappearing, it rinses off easily, and my face feels so much cleaner feeling than it has with other cleansers I have tried. I do use rose water and a natural moisturizer afterwards, and have to say that my skin looks brighter and healthier.I have not yet tried this product as a facial mask that would require leaving it on for 15-20 minutes, but I will try this in the near future. If this works as a mask, it would be so much better than the thick grey stuff you need to smear on your face and let it dry until it cracks. At this point, I am very happy with the results when using this product and would recommend it. As yet, I have had absolutely no problems with sensitivity or adverse effects. I will update this review if my opinion changes or if I have any additional information.UPDATE 7/04/18:For the last couple of weeks, I have tried applying this mask to my face before I take a bath and leaving it on until the end of my bath. As a mask, it doesn't get stiff and dry as other masks I have tried and it rinses off easily at the end of my bath. As a mask, I can't honestly say that it does much more than using it as a cleanser, but I do like the way my face feels after using it. As a scrub, I like it very much and will continue to use it.UPDATE 03/02/20:I am now 73 years old, and have been using this scrub for almost 2 years. To be honest, I haven't been consistent in when I use it. Sometimes I use it once a week and other times I go as much as a month between uses. What I have noticed when I use it is that my face feels silky smooth after I rinse it off. I have also noticed that none of the pores on my face look enlarged. I use warm water on my face before applying it and then use warm water to rinse it off. I still very much like this scrub and will continue using it. I am not good at taking selfies, but I have added a picture of me at 73. You be the judge.I hope this review was helpful for you. I will update it i my opinion changes."
"I can absolutely recommend this, especially if you’re dealing with very dry skin. I’m on a medication that has drained every bit of moisture out of me. In addition, I’m in my mid 60’s which makes it even worse. In my younger days, I was a manager for Clinique Cosmetics, so I knew the value of exfoliating before adding that expensive moisturizer, but I just couldn’t see forking out $30 for the Seven Day Scrub - one of the best  exfoliaters on the market. I took a chance and purchased this. It is definitely just as good and a little goes a long way. I’ll continue to buy it once this is gone."
"I’ve only used this product three times, as it’s still a new item in my skincare routine. However, happy to share don’t experience redness or stinging. Skin feels smooth and accepts serum quickly after use. Believe this is a great addition."
This is gentle on the skin.  I haven’t had it long enough to see a difference.  I’ve used it twice and my skin seems smooth afterwards!
The best face scrub I have ever used. You only need a tiny bit and it covers ur whole face.
I do like the ingredients. It was very nice as a mask. It’s a little too rough as a cleaners for my skin. It does leave my skin feeling very soft and clean. Just leaves a burning feeling for about a day when I touch my skin. So I will only use as a mask
"I started working in beauty salons when I was 11 years old.  Since then I’ve been hooked on products and this one is a great value for a very good quality product.  It’s a nice scrub but not too harsh, with very creamy properties as well (the manuka honey scent and texture really comes through) which gives me a sense that I am thoroughly removing blackheads and dead skin on my decoulletage as well without scraping such delicate areas.  Great product for the over 40 crowd (men and women)!"
This has my face so clean and feels amazing thx
Exellent product
I apply sunblock on face consistently during all my golf games. Need a good exfoliator to rid the residue.  Seems to be what I need.
A clear skin look after using this product. Goes a long way.
say what you will this works for me. The only wash that gets deep and fully cleanses. Also removes makeup really well. sometimes i go in with an exfoliating glove for and extra push lol. Love it otherwise. Remember.. God is good. Be blessed
I like unscented. This seems to be or  has very little that doesn't last. It works great. I use it daily
I love Aveno face scrub. It keeps my face clean and shiny. It does not make my face dry.
Descent scrub
Keeps my sensitive skin bright.  Using for years.
It's a little difficult to give to my cat as he refuses to lick it off my finger so I must put it in his mouth.  But it does work well and helps him to poop.
"This product has a very pleasant smell and goes on very well. Feels good going on. What I was most pleased about was the results After using this on my face. My face looked very clean, shiny and just felt refreshed."
I use this scrub every other day.  My skin is too dry and sensitive to use every day.  I like that it smoothes my skin.
I order 7 oz i reciv 2 oz  its really bad!!!!!!
"It was the perfect size, like the natural color, and loved how it feels on the skin, not too rough but it does the job."
"I have used many loofahs over a long period of time. This one is, by far, the best I've ever had (and that's from a guy who's been shaving his head and shining it up with the loofah for 25yrs). I received this on 7/11/21, but it's gotten good amount of use thus far.Feel:After soaking, the first use was way better than expected. Softened right up way better than anything in the past and definitely not as rough as others have described here. I bought the back scrubber as well and that thing is equally impressive (highly recommend).  They both do an outstanding job on exfoliation - my skin is noticeably smoother/cleaner/shiner.Quality:The cotton backing on the pad and scrubber is very soft, luxurious and has been amazingly durable. I have yet to find any rips or tears in the stitching or hand straps on either the pad or the back scrubber and the loofah sides on both still look like they did day one. The hand strap on the pad is comfortable and doesn't slip off my hand. The rings on the scrubber are very durable as I have really long arms, so they get stretched pretty good.Price:You get what you pay for. Anyone who is loofah-savvy knows this a heck of a deal for the quality and end result of your skin. I paid ~$23 for both and it's been more than worth it. But, I will give them some more time and re-evaluate them (but I suspect they will hold up)."
I found this scrub to be well made and useful. Fits well into palm of your hand .
I ordered these because they looked to be of very good quality. Received them yesterday and tried one of them out today in the shower. As soon as it got wet I saw that about a quarter of it had pulled away from the seam as shown in the photo. This happened before I used it on my skin. I used it anyway and really liked the way it made my skin feel. Just don’t see how they will last through many showers.
"The Almooni Natural Loofah Exfoliating Body Scrubber is an excellent addition to my shower routine. Made from natural Egyptian loofah, this body scrubber offers gentle yet effective exfoliation that leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. The fact that it comes in a 2-count pack is great, as I can use one for my body and one for my face, or keep a backup handy.The loofah expands nicely when wet and is perfect for removing dead skin cells without being too harsh. I’ve noticed a big difference in how clean and soft my skin feels after using it. It’s also suitable for both men and women, and it’s easy to hang up to dry between uses, which helps prevent mildew.If you’re looking for a natural, eco-friendly exfoliating sponge that’s great for both face and body, this pack is a fantastic choice. It’s durable, effective, and leaves your skin feeling rejuvenated after each use."
"While I do use wash cloths to clean my face, I love scrubbing my body to get the days dirt/sweat off my skin every night. This loofah feels amazing and I really like that it has a strap that you can put your hand under to really give yourself a good scrub down. Hard scrubs on the skin may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but it’s mine."
"Surprise it’s better than expected.  Thick, easy to hold and lathers up great!"
"I think the exfoliation side material is a bit too rough for anyone's skin even after putting the scrub in the washer and after a few uses, the softer side is nice but it also is a bit inconvenient having a strap holder for your hand on there for when you need to use the soft side, cause the strap isn't even the same material"
"I was in the market for a new exfoliating routine as I have always noticed that I feel better when I am exfoliated and free of excess dead skin.I came across this particular product whilst reading a marketing article for skin-based items and thought it would make for a nice addition to my exfoliation arsenal.This glove has worked wonders! It quite literally helps to shed off any dead skin and you can see it roll off of your body and onto the glove. That image may be slightly morbid, but it’s true. I have exfoliated off and on for years and had yet to see a product take away the kind of skin that this glove takes away.The best thing about this product, in my opinion, is the convenience factor. Yes, you can exfoliate with a washcloth, a loofah, a bar, or any tool of your choice. Or, you can slip on a glove that fits very snugly around your hand and scrub away with relative ease compared to other methods.I did not notice any bleeding of dye as some consumers have reported. I will say that I recommend only using this glove with a soap or cleanser of your choice. Using it with only water was much too rough on my sensitive skin and I will not be doing that again. So, unless you have skin that very badly needs some tough love, I would use something that lathers nicely and is very soft with this glove.All in all, this product works and is über convenient."
"I have tried a lot of tools, gloves, brushes, scrubs for body skin exfoliation--have to confirm that this simple mitt is the best one. Several minutes of soaking in hot bath, then use this mitt and you will see the effect immediately with all these small parts of dead skin left on the mitt. After exfoliation, you will feel smoothness and silkiness of your skin, as it should be! It works really fantastic. Only be cautious -- hot water and this mitt may also provoke peeling of your nail polish on a working hand, so it is better to use it on the day of manicure change ;)"
"I recently tried the Exfoliating Mitt, the fact that it comes in a two-pack, covering you for half a year, is already a great deal.Upon using it for the first time, I was amazed at how much dead skin it effectively removed, especially from my notoriously dry and flaky ankles. Pairing it with lotion afterwards left my skin feeling incredibly soft and rejuvenated.What sets this mitt apart is not just its exfoliating power, but also the inclusion of instructions on various ways to use it. Whether you're targeting rough patches or aiming for an allover glow, this mitt has you covered. I definitely be purchasing these again."
These mits are like magic!  I have gifted them to family and friends and each time they use for first time they are astonished!  This exfoliates you like nothing else.  You girls that self tan or spray tan BUY THESE!  I just got spray tanned for my sisters wedding and the lady said she’s been tanning people for 25 years and my skin prep was like no other!  You will be shocked with what comes off your body!  I waited way too long to leave a review because I have been purchasing for years.  Worth every penny!!!
"Love these mitts. They not only make my skin feel soft and smooth, they have radically reduced ingrown hairs and post-shaving bumps. I use it all over. More gentle with cetaphil. Less gentle if you use on damp but not wet skin. Also really nice before self-tanning. really gets rid of the dry skin. Can't recommend this enough."
The mits are very rough. Good for exfoliating but I wouldn’t purchase again.
"In our nationality we use a special rock to exfoliate our body,  but I lost mine years ago. This works just as good. I love seeing the dirt come of me. You think just soaping up with a towel gets you clean. Hell no. This is amazing. My skin feels soo clean and soft. I'm buying more to keep in stock because you should replace it every 3 months I believe. I like the black one because you can really see the dirt & dead skin come off."
"I don't usually write 5 star reviews unless they are 100% true, but this product deserves it! It's a little gross, but it removes the entire layer of dead skin from my body. It leaves my skin super smooth, with minimal texture. The bumps on my arms have started to disappear, and my 'strawberry legs' isn't as bad after I shave. I also just feel cleaner over all, and it's wonderful."
Worked as perfectly as I expected
Lo usé ayer y hoy mi piel está llena de granitos :(
"I bought these exfoliating mitts because the price was right and I figured I had nothing to lose. I did lose, though; I lost all of my dry, dead skin!I will start out by saying that these mitts are on the small side, and they shrink a bit the first couple of times that you use them. I have very small hands, so I appreciated that these fit my hands well and were snug enough to not move around while I'm using them. If you have large hands or long fingers, these mitts might be a bit snug for you.I discovered that these mitts work best dry, on damp skin. I usually shower and do my thing, then turn the water off and let my skin drip dry. Once I'm only damp (not dripping wet), I scrub myself down with a dry mitt. My skin quickly goes rosy pink without having to apply much pressure, and my dead skin rolls off in clumps. Literal clumps. I use these mitts about once a week, and each time, the bathtub floor is left covered in dead skin clumps. It is simultaneously disgusting and satisfying. Thr skin coming off reminds when using these mitts reminds me of when I've had bad sunburns in the past and my skin just peeled off in strips. It looks like that. I made the mistake once of trying to use the mitt before my skin had dried a bit, and it did nothing, so make sure your skin is only damp, not wet! That's the key!Since discovering these mitts, I've now reordered twice. I really like the way my skin feels now that I've incorporated them into my routine; particularly the backs of my arms and backs of my thighs, which had previously been rough and bumpy but are now SMOOTH and SOFT. I've noticed a huge difference in the texture of my skin and I couldn't be happier with my results. I find that each mitt does about 4-6 full body sessions before losing its exfoliation power, so at one session per week the 2 pack of mitts lasts me 2-3 months. I had previously been using an exfoliating scrub, which doesn't even compare to how soft and smooth my skin is now that I'm using these mitts regularly. Happy customer."
Lovely
Would recommend over and over again
"I have very sensitive skin and the product burned a bit. The first time I used it, but I added more water and it was much better. I actually like it a lot and it is a great exfoliation. Good value for the money. Just make sure you add enough water to the mixture if you have sensitive skin."
We love this product.  It will keep the heels of your feet & hands & other parts of the body extremely soft & eliminates some of our dryness from living in the midwest.
"I picked up the Turmeric scrub after using the Superfood scrub for over a year and, for the first time in my life (I am 39) experiencing a clear face with absolutely no acne or blemishes. A week without the Superfood and the blemishes started to return. Unfortunately, Superfood did not pop back up as an available option here, so in desperation I read the ingredients on all other scrubs by M3 and picked the Turmeric. It burns my face, and because of the ingredients and smaller coarse/exfoliating particles, it does not easily move across the face to effectively exfoliate the way the Superfood did. I will say that it moisturizes better, but I have a fragrance-free light facial lotion for that and believe that, overall, this product just won't replace what I came to enjoy in the Superfood blend. Such a bummer, now I am on the hunt once again to find a product that will help with breakouts."
"My skin feels so much smother after I use this,  the smell is pleasing, and I just can't say enough good things about it.. the only negative is I use to much, so it won't last long."
"It’s hard to believe that a black, gritty product would leave skin so soft and smooth, but it does.  Indulge yourself and reap the benefits."
"This might not be a product made for me as a 28 y/o man but it seems to work.Not a fan of the smell. Maybe I got a bad batch or it ""expired"" (bought mid April) but I don't find the smell very pleasant. It's hard to describe. It's not a terrible smell but I find myself holding my breath when using it, however it could just be me. The scrub seems to be quite abrasive when I use it and cleans my face really well. Along with a change in diet and regular exercise, I've noticed less acne and breakouts.For the men, I'd highly recommend you do not use this scrub right after shaving your face. I've made that mistake and it REALLY BURNS. Way more so than other exfoliation scrubs and face washes.Overall it's a decent product that seems to work well. This just might not be made for me is all due to the cons I've described."
"Leaves my face, & body feeling great. Don’t let it get In your mouth while washing your face though, it tastes awful"
"I read good things about this product on a few social pages. When ordering I didn’t notice, still not sure, if this scrub is supposed to be unscented? I have a very sensitive sense of smell and the product has an odd, sort of stale oil smell. I was able to remedy this by mixing in a couple drops of natural, lavender oil. I do like how it exfoliates my body/face, and leaves my normal to dry skin soft and smooth."
I love this product!  My skin is so soft.  I will definitely be buying again
The product smoothes skin
Great scrub
This is not too harsh on skin and seems to be working good. Although too early to report any actual changes. But does seem organic product
"I have eczema patches on my legs arms and hands, I didn’t think it would burn me like it did the product. I did avoid any spots that I had a break out but when the water rinsed over it as I was washing it off it was extremely painful. So note people with problem skin please avoid! I figured with all the natural oils it would have cut down on the affects of salt on a wound but I was very wrong."
"This scrub does exactly what it claims. My face feels smooth after using, allowing my serums and moisturizers to really penetrate and work as they are suppose to. I have tried others, just because I always get this one here, and I forget to order sometimes, but they never compare. (And are all currently in my bathroom cabinet nearly full! 😂)  This is NOT a gentle scrub, but that’s why I like it, so if you don’t like an actual grainy scrub texture, this is not for you. I’ve been buying this for at least 5 years now, and will continue to do so!"
"I bought this based on the reviews and price.  I liked it the first time and have been very satisfied with how soft and clean my skin feels after using.  It does have a slight smell, but it's not offending and I'm assuming it's the sea kelp.  Very good product and will certainly buy it again."
Bought this after seeing it recommended on a Pinterest board. It is very gritty and exfoliates really well. My face feels so smooth after using it. If you have sensitive skin you might want to do a test spot as it is very rough feeling. I use it twice a week and will definitely buy again.
Definitely in great facial scrub it does have a little bit of a weird smell but it's not overpowering it definitely you can feel it scraping off the dead skin but I would not recommend to use this product everyday because it could definitely be harsh on your skin so definitely take precaution when using this product do not overuse
"I use this 3 times a week and at first I thought it was going to be to abrasive and drying. Wrong. I use mine when I take a shower and with a nickel size amount. Rub my hands together then I do my face, neck and upper chest.  Rinse. I feel clean and refreshed. Great product for me."
This scrub is the real deal. It leaves my face clear and clean. If you have sensitive skin it might be aggravating. For me personally it’s the best option I’ve found and it’s inexpensive.
"I used this for almost two years; it's been perfect.  My clean always feels clean, fresh, and smooth.  Both of my sons, who have sensitive skin, also use this product and they've never had a problem. It smells good, which is a plus."
"This product is fantastic! I use it all the time and am probably on my 4th or 5th purchase. I use it once a week-ish, whenever my face starts to feel rough or dry. I've used it in the shower for a quick scrub and also as a sort of face mask, leaving it on for 10 or 15 mins and then washing it off. It works great for either. I've occasionally used it on my arms and legs too. It leaves my skin so soft and moisturized. Its a really nice, refreshing way to wake up if you use it in the morning. Using it this way, 1 bottle lasts for a couple months at least."
Très bon gommage pour le visage il nettoie en profondeur qui rend la peau de mon visage très lisse et prête à recevoir une crème hydratante ou votre sérum quotidien!
"De los mejores exfoliantes del mercado sin químicos abrasivos, rinde muchisimo, neceditas una pequeña cantidad para rostro y cuello. Esta marca tiene excelentes productos."
Excellent good
Best scrub
"Been using it for about a month or two and this does brighten my face a little, it’s a really good product and would definitely recommend..it doesn’t break me out and I like the colour to be honest, would repurchase again🫶🏽"
"I previously used witch hazel wipes each evening to cleanse. I saw a review on these and tried them, and love them! They have a slight texture to make them more effective. They are fine on my sensitive skin, and easy to pack to bring with."
"I love using these in the morning, before I apply all of my facial serums, moisturizers, and makeup.  I also use them at night at the end of the day. Not only do these pads exfoliate, but they also clean all of the makeup from my face really well. Since using these, my skin looks, and feels so much better. I also have sensitive skin, and these work great on my skin."
This facial pads are nice to  use a few times a week.  I use it after washing my  face and it's  not drying at all. It didn't have a strong scent.
"My dermatologist told me that I needed to start lightly exfoliating everyday and recommended these, I love them they're not harsh there is no smell and is really helped with my skin and makeup routine"
"I have very sensitive skin and started using these exfoliating pads a few days ago and already noticed my skin looks better. My pores look tighter and The small white bumps around my nose are clearing up. I would definitely be ordering these again, especially since they don’t irritate my very sensitive skin."
"Have been wanting to try this brand and the exfoliating products especially. Have VERY reactive skin and the best thing I can say about this product is that it IS gentle. However, so gentle it doesn’t “do” anything as far as I can tell. I have dry skin. I wanted to notice some mild difference. At $1/pad that I didn’t realize I was paying (thought I was getting 60ct instead,) I do expect noticeable improvement or at least sensation of such. This is a glorified astringent pad from a luxury priced company. I struggle to find products gentle enough that aren’t CeraVe or LaRoche Posay. Some of those are even too harsh. However, this product does treat me gently. It’s just that it feels and works about as well as water alone to me. I will use them up and not be repurchasing unless they provide some sort of commutative benefit—buyer beware."
I have got to where I only have to use it 1 to 2 times a week to exfoliate my skin. It really has changed my skin tone and texture for the better. It doesn’t smell strong and it’s super easy to use. Good quality for the price!
These facial radiant pads are a must each morning.  Swipe before putting on moisturizer to give a healthy glow to skin. There is no fragrance and they do not irritate the skin. The price is worth it!
"This did great things for my skin. And the pads were robust enough that you could use the other side as well, so one pad could work for morning and evening. Will buy again."
First time using these and after 4 days they have made such a difference!
"I read the reviews before I used these and was impressed enough to go ahead and buy them especially as one said they didn’t affect her rosacea.,Afer doing my usual nightly  routine it made my rosacea appear very quickly and I had the first flare up in a while., so sadly not for me."
I don’t think these all that good
It will leave your skin soft from the first try.
"I was always a fan of the Bath and Body Works scrubs and the Tree Hut ones, but this scrub hands down is the best! Not only does it make your skin instantly smooth and soft, the oils in it somehow make your skin look super super glowy. This is great for dry skin. I won't be using any other scrub. I got the large size this time because the small size, I went through it in a week."
"It's quite oily, but I like the smell, texture, and appearance. It works well for my skin and keeps it moisturized."
This salt scrub was outstanding. It left my skin feeling refreshed and and smooth. I have used salt scrubs for years and this one is at the top of my list now.
"The only con is that it tends to burn my lips if I get this on them. Other than that I would recommend this. It leaves your face feeling silky smooth and is the perfect balance for scrubbing the pores, not to rough but exfoliating enough to know it's cleaning to give you that glowing look. Skin looks so much healthier after using this 3-4 times a week for 2 months now."
"Half of it spilled into the cardboard box. For $18, i would like it nicely kept in the box and professional but it spilled like this upon arrival. I tested it on my face and it feels great. I just wish it wasn't opened, and half way gone now. would have rated it 5 stars if it wasn't halfway spilled."
This stuff is a miracle worker!! The scrub really works so much better than sugar. But be warned! It will burn scraps and cuts!!!Also everyone keeps talking about a scent… but mine doesn’t have one. Just a strong smell of the oils used. I think if I use all the oil I’ll keep applying more to the salt scrub to dilute and even out
Me encanta como me deja la piel y el trabajo que está haciendo en mi
"I don't do many reviews but I had to review this product.  I use exfoliating scrubs all the time but was never quite satisfied with the other ones I used.  Some are either too harsh (like apricot scrub otc) or some don't have enough exfoliation beads.  This one, however, was PERFECT!! It has a lot of exfoliation beads and as soon as I rinsed it off, my face felt SOFTER and more renewed.  I was like Wow.  And even an hour later, my face is still feeling so soft and just better!!  I highly recommend this!!"
"I was under the impression that there would be tiny ""beads"" in this, but they are more like sand. With that been said, they did not scratch my face and my face feels cool and clean after use. I will definitely buy again. Wish they sold bigger tube's."
"The first time I used this I saw an immediate improvement in my complexion. I felt clean and ""renewed"". I learned right then and there just how careless I had gotten with my face. This was used in conjunction with an electric facial cleansing scrubber, which I think had something to do with the overall results."
"I've only used this twice, but so far I like it! I definitely feel a smoother texture in my skin. I can tell that for my skin type, I should not use more than twice per week, because I feel like I'm borederline dry. However, I haven't had a chance to put on any other products yet. My only complaint is that after the 2nd use, I feel like it left a cleaner/chemically type smell. It's definitely different than the 1st time I used it."
Smells great and has made noticeable difference in texture of my skin after just a few uses. Wish I would have discovered this sooner. Exfoliates gently without drying or irritating skin. Nice price point too!  Thumbs way up.
"I love this face scrub! It has an amazing smell, and the texture feels great. My skin always feels super smooth after I use it. Would definitely recommend."
"This is a great scrub that really works to smooth skin, however, for all my other sensitive, combination, acne prone fair skinned people out there I highly recommend only using once a week unless you really need more exfoliation. I very lightly went over my face and my face was lightly red and mildly irritated for 4 days after use. You don't need to rub hard or you will cause a lot of damage. The scrub may feel like a finer version of wet beach sand, but don't take that for granted, it's powerful stuff and worth every penny."
I like every Bliss product i have tried and this one is great also. It has a fine sand grit for exfoliating which does not irritate my face but definitely feels like it gives a little extra clean when i use it weekly.
It was not too roughVery good
"I used this product some years ago and was so happy to find it again on Amazon. It’s amazing takes away all the grime from your skin without causing (me) redness, or dry skin - I do have sensitive skin and can use this a couple of times a week for a good scrub. Highly recommended and I will be buying again, thank you"
"This is far better than a scrub, its super fine texture makes you think its not going to be as good as some of the more grainy scrubs, but it works much better leaving your skin really soft.  The minty tingle is surprising at first but makes you feel wide awake.  Bought this a few times now, its difficult to get hold of sometimes but well worth buying!"
"Love this product, have been repurchasing it for years!"
"This is a good exfoliator. Bit it doesn't feel ground breaking or anything. You get a better, cleaner skin after but many othrr products are probably better."
"I love using body scrubs to help exfoliate and I’ve tried many. Some are too dry and aren’t moisturizing, some are too rough and feel like they’re scratching your skin. This scrub is just right. I love how it leaves my skin so moisturized after a shower. It also smells delicious."
"The scrub has enough salt to exfoliate while the coconut milk moisturizes your skin. Usually scents bother me, but this smells amazing. I just got it today so I’ve only used it once, but I’m hoping that it’s as good at lessening wrinkles as it is at exfoliating and moisturizing."
"Like half of America, I seem to be obsessed with facial moisturizers and related products.  (And like half of America, I rarely leave reviews anymore, but this is a worthy exception)I had been using pureSCRUBS ""Premium Organic Brown Sugar [various scents]"" which sells for 3x this price: https://a.co/d/1TYDyiM [Unscented, but they cost all the same] Meanwhile, THIS brand (Brooklyn Botany) is 1/3 the price, plus Amazon was doing a discount the day I picked up a container for $9. Compare the price to $29 for pureSCRUBS, and you need to ask: is there a real difference?Bottom line: no.  Major differences are few:  Brooklyn brand granules are a bit smaller (noticeable on face), but still does a fantastic job at exfoliating.  The pureSCRUBS also includes Aloe Vera and Shea Butter, this one does not -- but nearly ALL the other ingredients are the same oils (almond, jojoba, etc). After s proper damping of skin and then using the products thoroughly on the face, your face feels (and looks--30 day results) nearly the same.The ""organic"" part of pureSCRUBS is nonsense, because you are not ingesting this. The Aloe Vera (and SHea Butter) would be worth something IF it was staying on your skin for several hours (it is not). It's also not clear howmuch pureSCRUBS includes in apples-to-apples one scoop (tips of fingers handful = approx 3 tbsp I uase) to then wash with.SO: $29 or $9? There is a size difference (pureSCRUBS is 16 oz, Brooklyn is 10 oz: not enough to make up for the extra $$$).  The granule size is noticeable larger on pureSCRUBS, but in actual usage, no difference because BOTH exfoliate well. pureSCRUBS gives you a cugte mixing spoon (you'll never use it) and a loofah pad (you'll unlikely use it since 90% of people wash with hands--as hands can feel your face and you can get into all the nooks (and neck).pureSCRUBS does offer a lot of scents, but frankly the brown sugar component is the most overpowering aspect, and then the oils, I doubt you will notice the fragrance--plus, you watch this off after 5-10 minutes or however long your routine is.That said, I DO like pureSCRUBS better for some reason, but the price doesn't justify.  If price is NOT an issue, go for pureSCRUBS. Good luck.(Note “Dead Sea Salt” from pureSCRUBS is a waste of money capitalizing on Dead Sea salt craze.  No benefits. Stick to brown sugars. :-)"
"I can’t say enough about this company. The scrub works well, smells great, last a long time and it’s very inexpensive.It is a great alternative to the Peter Thomas Roth products"
"The oil which helps the salt scrub work leaked out. There was a huge oil stain on the outside of the box, inside and through the paper. Luckily I have both almond oil and jojoba oil on hand so I should be able to make t still work."
I always prefer a salt scrub over a sugar scrub. This one is very good. The scent is light and airy and leaves your skin very smooth. Would recommend it as a good skin care product.
I lightly scrubbed my face with this last night and my skin was a smooth as silk!  I will use it in the shower next time ... I love the smell.
"I've been using this for two years. Keeps my KP at bay, wakes me up and lets my extremely sensitive skin feel silky smooth with no negative side effects like other scrubs. Lifelong customer <3"
"huele delicioso, al tener muchos aceites te deja la piel súper súper súper suaaave y se siente humectada, no lo recomiendo para pieles sensibles por que lit es echarte granos de azúcar en el cuerpo, a mi me encantaaa"
Smells great and reduces bumpy skin texture really well. This does not emulsify when you wash it off so it’s best to follow up with a gentle cleanser to remove excess oil. Leaves skin feeling soft and moisturised.
جيد
I love how it makes my skin feel
"Producto agradable y si funciona, viene en poca cantidad, pero hidrata increíble la piel y si se ve mejora en la piel."
"I bought this product a few years ago and I loved how it took all my dead skin off with just a rub on my face and it felt great afterwards my face felt vibrant and clean , I get why the price is higher because it works. I make it one of my weekly routines"
"THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING. When I ordered this product, I had previously done a whole research on Asian skin care products and found out that most of them were really expensive and sometimes didn't even work. So when I came across Cure Natural Aqua Gel on a Youtuber's Channel and found it was really inexpensive, with positive reviews, I was really excited to try it out. It arrived really fast and with no problems. My product was easy to apply since it came with English instructions on the back. When I applied it on my face, slowly and gently massaging it, I felt a bunch of little balls coming off. I was surprised that such a soft and gentle exfoliator could have such an enormous effect, so I checked the product to see if it had any hidden balls within it but found none. So, as I like to think, I conducted a small experiment that goes as follows:  ""Since some parts of our bodies have higher or lower concentration of dead cells, if I use the same amount of product on these areas I should get a different amount of dead cells. And if I get the same amount of ""balls"" it means it is all within the product. (Making sense? It does in my head XD)I decided to test two areas: 1) The elbows, 2) The faceWhy? Well, if there is a part of the body people clean(or at least within my family) it's the face. I know I am too lazy to scrub my body every single day and thus my elbows don't get such a nice treatment. Besides, elbows are a joint where skin accumulates, thus more dead cells. ( I am not an expert)Procedure:So I pumped twice and applied it on my elbow which I know has a big concentration of dead cells. And as hypothesized( if you like to think of it that way ;D) a big amount of balls formed. Then, I applied the same amount of product to a part of my dad's face as equal in surface area as that of my elbows (I had already exfoliated mine so it doesn't count). My conclusion was that the product truly works, because the same amount of product generated different amounts of balls, meaning it must have reacted to the skin. It's a weird way of testing it out and I know many factors could have influenced the answers but all you really need as proof, is the feel of your skin.Review: To really appreciate a product I write down my expectations VS. reality and with these, I draw my ""real expectations"" because having realistic expectations in mind really help to appreciate any product and understand it's value. For me these were my Expectations Vs RealityExpectationsYes, we all have wished our acne would simply disappear, together with the scars and all those skin problems after one application. ""My skin will turn to a beautiful and healthy glowing and perfect skin.""RealityAfter years of doing nothing to my skin( I am guilty -.-), it won't go away magically, and if it does call me. Skin needs time to repair, so I have to be patient. There is no ""perfect"" skin so I should love my skin the way it is even though I look like a Mexican version of a vampire.Results The product is as gentle as you want it to be( if your not gentle with your skin you can scar it even more -.- like I did when I exfoliated with sugar and rubbed so hard on my skin). It has only being 2 weeks, and  My acne is still there, but it has tremendously dwindled. I used to have acne all over my cheeks and now I only get one pimple every other day. My skin doesn't ""glow"" in the dark (LOL) but it does look a little more healthy and not so dull. The product has caused no ""after effects"", it is pleasant to use and has done close to magic for my skin \(^_^)/OVER ALL I am so happy with this beautiful product sent from heaven. I have lived with acne my whole life like a lot of people, and I did my research, bought this product and now I am happy. It is worth every penny, and it does wonders(at least to my face), fast shipping, you name it.I use this product with my skin care routine which is as follows:1) A make up remover (if you wear make up, I don't so I can't recommend any but oils are good too if you want a more natural way)2) A cleanser- use any of your preference, i haven't found a favorite yet.3) An exfoliator- THIS ONE!4) A toner- for this I use half Apple cider vinegar and half water because i don't like the idea of rubbing any alcohol product on my face.5)A moisturizer- Even if I have oily skin, I moisturize my skin(I think is very important but can't tell if it will make it worst for others or not) I recommend Aveeno6) Masks- sometimes I use honey for my red scars, or clay masks work too (Indian Clay)7) A Spray - Avene Thermal Spring water spray is great to keep face moisturize if you don't want to apply face cream often, its a lighter feeling.Sorry for my bad English, Spanish is my first language. This is only my opinion and my craziness :D"
"If you’re looking for something similar to sakura silk, this is a very close second. I only use it for my cuticles, so I don’t have an opinion about how it works on the face"
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Left my face feeling super clean and smooth. I did not like that there is alcohol in it because it made my face feel very dry. I think it would be great for someone who has oily skin."
The gentle exfoliation works on my skin.  Love it!
The product is reliable. I have used this item for more than 10 years now. First purchased in San Francisco Japan town.
"Perfect for sensitive skin, gets rid of dead skin cells makes skin super soft"
"last bottle I received is a nearly expired product, it does not work as usual and is very liquid."
"I have tried MANY of these peeling gels. First they do work but not how you think. It’s not skin peeling of it’s the product but those pillings of the cellulose stick to dead skin cells and mildly physically exfoliate; in a rounded way in a way that doesn’t scratch the skin. If you overuse them all that will happen is this fell will stick to really dry patches and not come off and I end up getting it off with an oil cleanser. When I am using actives this is a non negotiable as a daily makeup wearer. After a couple days of actively skin will get flakey and this is the only thing that works. The classic exfoliators cause the skin to harden, washcloths don’t get all the flaking off. This works just enough to remove the slight flaking and prep skin for hydrating products then makeup. This is the best of all the others and I don’t know why it took me so many years to come back to this. I also love the pump. You get what you pay for!"
"Es un producto excepcional, es realmente bueno:)"
good result. expectation fulfilled
超オイリー肌で超汗かき(特に顔)の私。クレンジング、洗顔後にざらつきを感じる時に週2〜3日使用してます。翌朝は良い感じにしっとりです。
Love love love this product ❤️
"I recently purchased the UJFQBH 3 Pieces African Bath Sponge Set in Pink, Yellow, and Purple, and I am beyond impressed! These sponges have quickly become a game-changer in my daily skincare routine. Here’s why:1. Excellent Exfoliation: The texture of the sponges is perfect for gently exfoliating my skin without being too harsh. My skin feels noticeably smoother and refreshed after each use.2. Great for Hard-to-Reach Areas: The long net design makes it super easy to scrub my back and other hard-to-reach places, which is something regular loofahs struggle with. I love how flexible and versatile it is!3. Durable and Long-Lasting: Even after multiple uses, these sponges hold up well. They dry quickly, so there’s no concern about mildew or unpleasant odors.4. Vibrant Colors: The Pink, Yellow, and Purple sponges are fun and vibrant, adding a bit of color to my bathroom. Plus, having three sponges means I can rotate between them.Overall, this set is fantastic for anyone looking for an effective, durable, and affordable body scrubber. My skin has never felt smoother, and I highly recommend it for daily use!"
"I recently purchased the African Bath Sponge, and it has completely transformed my shower routine! The long net design is perfect for reaching every part of my body, especially those hard-to-reach areas. The texture provides excellent exfoliation, leaving my skin feeling incredibly smooth and refreshed after every use.I also love how quickly it dries, which helps prevent any odors or mildew from forming. The material is durable and long-lasting, which is a huge plus compared to other sponges that fall apart after a few uses. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a deep clean and a more invigorating shower experience. This is a must-have in my daily skincare routine!"
For me this works great. I have a small farm and I feel like this net sponge really gets the dead skin and grime off. My skin has felt softer since using it and I just feel cleaner too I really like the size I feel like that helps to get my back better too and I do feel the material really helps exfoliate my skin I feel like my skin looks healthier and more clear since using this
"Upon opening it does have a funky smell but thats why it says to soak it in soapy water for 15 minutes. And you don’t really have to clean the sponge itself after ur done, as long as u wash everything off with water and dry it it’s good to go for the next day. A few scrubs of this thing and it gets rid of the dead skin. I scratch my skin with my nails after and theres no gunk in there that I usually get. It lathers up soap quite nicely too.I also do use it on my face, but gently since it does have a rough texture. If you also want to use it around your privates its also good, it easily removes the built up sweat and dead skin down there.The length of it also makes it easy to scrub your back without struggle.Sometimes little bits of it fall off but that’s alright. After you’re done just give it a good squeeze and shake and it’s already almost dry."
Just tried it and loved it makes my skin so soft definitely recommend! There is a fish smell when I first got it but once you wash it it’ll go away I love that it’s so easy to use in hard to reach places the length is very nice I also saw there was an option to cut it or to leave it long I decided to leave it long the absorbency is also amazing! I only needed 2 droplets of my body wash & it started to sud up quickly the quality is overall amazing and I love the cleanser quality.
I have always wanted one of these so I finally gave it a try. I don’t know if it’s the real one or not but I can say it’s does wonders for my skin. My skin has been so soft and I feel extra clean. It’s not to rough but gives a great scrub. It’s dries really quick. I didn’t expect it to be so long but it helps with the hard to reach areas. I’ll will buy more to give to my mom and grandmother. They will love these and throw away those loofahs
Best thing I have ever bought. Lather up so good makes your skin feel so good after using this. Definitely buying again. Length is good to help clean your back yourself. Absorbs soap very great. Great quality
"This product has been a remarkable discovery, yielding noticeably smoother skin. It lathers beautifully and can be used in either the shower or tub, then conveniently hung to dry. I utilize a hook in my shower for storage. It significantly reduces wash rag laundry and performs exceptionally well."
I had razor bumps on my leg and my lower belly. I had use exfoliating gloves but that did not help with the razor bumps. So I purchased those and they are really great. They are harsh on the body at first but the more you use it the less harsh it becomes.
No son lo que esperaba. Pero es un buen precio por 3 aunque no sean las auténticas.
"I really like this product, and I literally could not find it anywhere In the market but I found it here . It works very well and provides good lather. And it's also very pocket friendly in a pack of 3 😁 👍length wise it's quite long , u can also cut it to your desired length for use."
Really nice worth the price
"ordered this and was absolutely disgusted by the smell. i decided to take a chance because i wanted an african net and majority of the reviews were positive, but not only was the item packaged extremely poorly but i coulnt even cope with touching the nets, because they smelt like old fish, absolutely disgusting do yourself a favour and do not order this!!!!!"
"I use this product once a week. It leaves my skin nice and soft, and I absolutely love it."
"This product really is great. Doesn’t has much odor, but does the job nicely."
"This seems like a gentle exfoliator which works great for me. I use it 3x a week and follow up with moisturizer. The first time I used it, I shed a lot of skin afterwards but now my skin feels softer and I see less dry patches.The only thing is that it can get a little messy because the granules are dark. That can be fixed by giving the shower/bath a good rinse afterwards but I can see it being challenging if you don't have a handheld showerhead."
"This product came recommended to me but I was skeptical in buying it because of the price. I went ahead and did it anyway and do NOT regret it. I love everything about this. The smell, the effectiveness. You only need a little so the bottle lasts a long time. Splurge a little and get it, so worth it."
PLEASE make this in a pump size because I amObsessed. Use it every day. Feels amazing and I love the smell juts hate having to uncap and re cap. And I need MORE
Smells great
"I've used a lot of scrubs and I also make my own body products (scrubs, shampoo bars, etc) and lotions.I like the ingredients that this product offers but I personally like a scrubby scrub. I liked that I could feel the physical exfoliant, but I wanted there to be more. Also, normally I can tell if the product is leaving oils behind and expecting it from the ingredients it offers. This product felt like it was leaving behind a residue and took longer to rinse off my skin.If you like a lower physical exfoliant, this product might be for you. For me, I may give it another try but I probably won't be reaching for it again after that."
Gentle and effective on my KP. Consistent use over a month and I’ve seen an improvement on my arms and legs. Smell is pleasant and natural. I use about a quarter size amount per leg and half that amount per arm. Am planning to repurchase once I run out.
It's a good product that is a tidy facial exfoliator.Not sure about using over the rest of your body.
I absolutely love them! They leave my skin feeling so soft and helped get the dryness off my legs 🙏
These gloves are very useful and helps clean your skin even better.
"These are thick and that softer type of exfoliating gloves which are so nice. These are not your scratchy, thin and rough dollar store variety. I did knock off a star however because it’s weird having a pair of gloves that don’t match. I wasn’t paying attention when I bought them and thought I was getting 4 pairs not 4 gloves because of the different colors. That’s my fault that I didn’t read that correctly in the description, but it’s odd having one hand wearing one color and the other hand wearing a different color. They need to make the pairs match in my opinion.  I also think spending $3.50 for a pair of shower gloves is a bit high. Great quality though."
"Used to exfoliate. Works great, washes in washing machine good. Thick material. Easy to use."
I love the pictures of the glove and how easy they are to use. Exfoliates my skin and keeps it soft. Fits my hand comfortably and dries quickly.
They deliver
"I have large,  but not overly large hands.  I find these very difficult to put on.  The material catches on my crooked fingers.  Once I get them on tho,  I like how they work.Update:  the company offered me a refund, but I don't think that is necessary.  I do have problems with my crooked fingers into the gloves, but it's not their fault."
This is not for those with sensitive skin because its quite rough in texture.  It takes only a wipe or two across my face to remove all the dead skin.  I use it dry though.  Now I am using it on my foot because I have a skin condition that causes severe itchiness and the glove works perfectly!  I'm planning to try it wet in the shower and see how it feels.  I'm very pleased with the gloves and wish I had purchased them sooner.
It is a one of the best exfoliating/ scrubs that I have used. I really like it and it is also a good price.
"I had never tried this brand, and opened big, buying 3 separate products. All 3 cheaper than one of my usual moisturizer. I was so very pleased with my results.I am 59 years old with fairly normal, albeit aging, skin.This left my face and neck feeling clean as a whistle, as well as super soft. I felt the tightening affects immediately and was afraid I may end up with some dryness. I did not. I RECOMMEND COMPLETELY!!"
This really helped my face look more smooth and pores less noticeable. Very gentle on skin too.
"With so many face cleaners on the market, it is sometimes hard to choose the right one. I read reviews on this one and thought I would try it. It smells good and leaves my face feeling soft & smooth. Will buy again."
"Loved this product, the only downside is that the bottle is glass, so when I was using it in the shower, it slipped and shattered everywhere."
"My skin has become so dry as I’ve gotten older. I do have a little bit of rosacea on my cheeks, and this is delicate enough that I can use it on my sensitive skin. I leave it in the shower and use it about twice a week and my skin feels nice and soft with no more dry patches."
This is my favorite exfoliator. Super fine grain leaves skin feeling soft & fresh 😊
"One of the best scrub especially for skin having scars. However, after using use a good toner. Instant results while gentle on skin. Must have it. this is the care you should giv to ur skin. Best ever."
"I never really leave reviews, but I just had to! I discovered this product on a skin care video on YouTube. After one use my skin wasn’t dull anymore, it glowed and when I say glowed I mean GLOWED. It removed all dead skin cells sat on my skin. I use it now twice a week and can’t believe how healthy my skin looks. I have sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate it at all. Best skin buy you’ll ever buy. I only ever use high end but this is far better! Love it! X"
"Este scrub tiene un textura increíble! Se siente una limpieza profunda al utilizarlo. Como dato, yo tengo la piel sensible y no me irrita para nada."
Es maravillosa
Bestes Gesichtspeeling für Zuhause. Geruch ist auch gut. Habe ich schon sehr vielen weiterempfohlen. Der Preis ist definitiv gerechtfertigt.Die Haut ist nach der Behandlung sehr stark gereinigt und fühlt sich wie nach einer Kosmetikbehandlung an.Ich habe Mischhaut trocken mit leichter Akne.
Great value and on first use you can see the results.  Skin glows and feels hydrated.
Really good product. My skin loved it. just a little expensive
This is a great face scrub to use daily. My skin feels soft. Been using for 5 weeks and I see a difference in my skin. Less clogged pores and soft. I use nightly. Price tag is step BUT it only takes a little bit....it goes a long ways.
This product is one of my all time favorites!
Got it for my mom who requested it and she loves it. She says it does everything it promises.
I have been using this product for several years and absolutely love it!
Works well
My skin is very oily so this product works great.
I love this stuff.  It preps my skin nicely for makeup because it exfoliates everything and leaves my skin smooth but doesn't dry it out.
Love this exfoliating scrub. Works perfectly
I used to use the Glow exfoliator from European Wax Center and would still end up with ingrown hairs. I’ve been using this one for over a month and haven’t experienced any ingrowns! Great product and a little goes a long way.
"It does the job. Good rich texture, and help me get rid of stubborn razor bumps and ingrown hairs"
"I’m pretty new to using scrubs before & after shaving or waxing so I’ve tried to be cheap &  used a regular body scrub and it seemed too harsh for my bikini area. I went to wash it off & noticed the exfoliation went way too deep in my dermis. So I invested in this during a sale. This reminds me of St. Ives Apricot Scrub. Same texture, almost same smell so I’m not all too impressed. I wish I could find more of a middle ground, but I will say that my hair is growing in a lot more softer & I have way less urge to scratch due to the irritation new hair would give. I’ll keep using it but I have yet to notice if it brightens or not."
"Smells great, will test it out after waxing"
"I feel like it doesn’t work that well, it’s not as good as my other scrubs and does not melt as easy. Definitely takes a lot of time to work it in and just overall, not worth it to me. Although there is a LOT of product and you don’t need to use that much so there is value if you like this."
Love this! Will definitely be on my reorder list.
"I have used many exfoliating scrubs before, this one is so far in my top 3, if not even my favorite so far.Smooth, pleasant smell, easy to open cover  (which I love, so no accidental spills or messes are happening).Is it worth the money for the amount? I would say YES, since a little goes a long way.Also using a exfoliating mitten i bought makes it first up easier to apply, using less of the product.I definitely can recommend to buy it!! Will buy again, even though it came 3 days late 😄P.S. I know it says Bikini exfoliating scrub, but I use it on my legs and underarms in between waxing!!!!"
Efficace
I could see a difference in 1 week of use
"Using this with exfoliating gloves and tend razor bump tonic, I've noticed my razor bump/ bikini bumps problem has had a great improvement than with me shaving and not using anything. I still get bikini bumps, however the extent of how bad it would be has decreased by a good 90% and that's my winning mu vote to upkeep 😁"
"After one use, my bumps are almost gone! Love this thing"
Kinda messy to use and has a Frankly very odd smell that is hard to describe. My wife uses it before she showers to it can be washed off during the shower
"I love this exfoliating brand. I can exfoliate every day. & A little goes a long way. You don't need a whole lot. The light scent smells nice. It helps so much with ingrown hairs and regular blemishes. Dries them up, makes them smaller, & then vanishes them with grace while keeping the skin soft and not dried out. I use Cerave lotion after using this and I feel like my skin can breathe."
I have tried several products for skin exfoliation.  This is the best by far.  Can use daily without damaging my skin barrier.  Recommended to family.
I really like this product. I use it nightly before bed. I am in my 70's and this helps with those tiny white bumps that seem to arrive with age.
"I got the Cetaphil Exfoliating Face Wash a while back but held off on reviewing it until I could fully test it out.  It did not disappoint! It leaves my face feeling so clean and refreshed. The scrub is gentle enough for daily use, which is perfect for my sensitive skin. I love how it smooths my skin without causing irritation. It effectively removes dead skin cells, leaving my face soft and glowing. Plus, it doesn’t dry out my skin—just the right balance of exfoliation and hydration. Having the pack of two is super convenient too!"
Exfoliante amable con tu piel.
I've used many facial wash products but this is a keeper. Works great and leaves my skin soft and clean.
"This exfoliating gel is very gentle on your skin, while also getting rid of makeup or smoothing very dryskin on your face. Since it is a gel, it is very easy to squeeze out just the right amount for your facewithout wasting any like you would with a liquid. I have used it for several years and in fact used itlast night to take off makeup!!"
I use all Cetaphil products but was looking for something with a little more scrubbers. Feels good and does help.
Buen producto
"Only received one item, but I was charged for the two pack."
Perfect product with affordable price
Very gentle on the skin. I have rashes and very sensitive skin and I can use it everyday.
Es un exfoliante muy suave pero no estoy segura de que desincruste suficientemente la suciedad. Siempre he tenido puntos negros y pensé que con este producto se iban a reducir pero la verdad es que siguen igual.El cambio que sí noté fue que mi piel no queda reseca y una acumulación de piel muerta que se me formaba en la barbilla ya no se forma tan fácilmente.No me gustó que no hace espuma o no sé si lo esté usando mal.
"I bought this to give it a try and I love it. I have strawberry legs and a strawberry (bottom). I mainly used this on my bottom to keep me feeling smooth and the difference is NOTICEABLE. My skin feels absolutely amazing after use, and I don't deal with stubborn ingrown, or raised pores anymore. I did not take away the strawberry look but it lightened it tremendously. It did so well that my legs never reverted which is why I kept this for my bottom particularly. Not to mention, my bottoms gotten its on set of compliments for being so smooth since usage (; lol! So it's noticeable not just to me, but to my partner as well."
"When I found this product I thought I had hit the jackpot, and I was correct.  I love using it before I shave my legs to help remove dead skin.  It makes my shaving much easier.  I also like using it occasionally for my whole body if I just feel super dirty like after I worked in the yard.  The exfoliating part of the bar is just right, it's not too soft yet it's not like the OG Apricot scrub from St. Ives that rubbed your skin raw.  If my husband would use it before he shaved, I think he would like it, but I have convinced him yet."
This is a great scrub soap. I definitely noticed the difference between shaves before and after using it.
"I have a hard time finding a product for my razor bumps. This is nice preshave, but I have noticed a difference in my overall skin appearance."
"I cannot express enough how much I love this bar! I bought this on a whim on my way to my vacation because I had forgotten my razor. It came with this bar and the razor Billie sells. I used to always get strawberry bumps after shaving and had tried every kind of shaving cream and none worked, until this. This is the fourth bar I've bought and will continue to buy them forever <3"
this is one of the most amazing things I have tried lately! I love how it leathers makes my skin so soft and does the job! I will be buying this again real soon!
"I have rough, darkened/scarred skin on my lower legs from past cases of eczema and injuries. I normally do not get a smooth shave, despite heavy moisturizer/scrub combos. I was trying to order same-day delivery on another item and needed additional $ to reach the minimum $25 subtotal. When I clicked the button for suggestions, this soap was the first item “recommended for you”. The reviews seemed positive so I ordered it. I AM VERY IMPRESSED! Not only did it help smooth the wrinkled skin but also gave me the smoothest shave I’ve had in forever. Yes it is way more than I spend on a bar of soap, but I believe it will be very beneficial in helping return my skin to the smoothness I had before the eczema and scarring. It is not a strong fragrance, which is a huge factor with my asthma. If ongoing results are what I anticipate they will be, I will be purchasing again."
Works nicely on my legs. Gave me a rash when I used it in my underarms.
"I noticed that now in my mid 40s my pores are more noticeable and I have a lot of uneven tone to my cheeks. Even with a good quality foundation, I didn’t like the way my skin looked by mid-day. Within days I saw a noticeable difference in my fine lines, skin looks fresher, much more even and pores refined."
"I have used this Niacinamide Serum and Glow Getter Body Butter and LOVED both products! Figured I’d try this one next!!Many dermatologists on TikTok have said one should refrain from using harsh exfoliants on the face but I REALLY like Clinique Men’s exfoliant once a week. After rinsing and waiting until it completely dries, I apply this liquid exfoliant. I do have sensitive skin but this combination of products never seems too harsh but I DON’T go crazy with the cream exfoliant.I continue with this product every other day and my skin has become smoother and brighter since I added it to my skin care regimen these past few weeks.Priced great! Pleasant smell. Another great addition in this  line of products!"
"Works well, on my second bottle now and my skin looks great"
Most people recommend that you use BHA every other day or thrice a week but I use this everyday and it's really not harsh on my skin. I can't wait to see the results once I'm done
I’ve been loving this for my skin and will be getting more when needed
"Recommended by professional makeup artist, this gentle exfoliant works extremely well.  Other 2% BHAs I've used in the past left my skin with dry, peeling spots, but not this one.  Really glad I tried it, and the price is so good!  Highly recommend."
"I am a big fan of Naturium serums and acids but this one doesnt hit the mark as an alternative to Paula's Choice. I bought it to save money b/c Paula's Choice BHA is 2x more expensive, but it is also 2x more effective. Sorry. Otherwise.. Naturium is absolutely better than Ordinary with their Mandelic Acid and other products."
"I am new to the world of chemical exfoliants and this product works wonderfully. I apply it to my face and it absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling refreshed. For extra exfoliation I use a cotton round to apply the product. I am able to use this product daily without any irritation."
El producto es bueno pero llegó derramado en la caja.
Original and good quality
"Not a good experience whatsoever… got delivered and I opened it to see liquid leaking from the bottle.Opened it up and there was liquid in the lid and the seal was lifted meaning it had been broken prior to delivery.Fuming cause I was looking forward to this product but now I obviously have to return it.By the other reviews, this looks like a frequent thing.But sketchy if you ask me…"
"It stung abit when I started this, use it for once per week and I'm used to it now... it's a good product for exfoliating."
The box had been opened and seal was not on. This is a scam do not buy
"I love this exfoliant. I think it may be the best one yet. I have pretty oily skin with some surface dryness and am acne prone. I've tried endless chemical exfoliants and they tend to break me out more. I do really like the dermalogica exfoliant powder but it's a little too expensive for me. I know this is on the pricier side, but a little really does go a long way and it lasts forever! I bought the smaller size and its great. The smell is pretty nice, but the color did throw me off. It is, in fact, meant to be green. Overall, a really really good product. I also love their sulfur based face wash!"
"Kate Somerville ExfoliKate Intensive Treatment is the best product I have ever used for exfoliating my face. The product really does get rid of the dead skin and my face is so smooth and refreshed after using it. I have used this product for many years, won't be without it."
Live the way my skin feels after using this mask! Follow the directions and don’t leave on for longer than two minutes though!
Best facial scrub I’ve found.
"This definitely exfoliated my skin well and left it feeling smooth and supple. I did  think the size was larger when ordering it and surprised myself that it was so small. Luckily a little  does go along way. Other than the small amount you get for the price, I would highly recommend this wash."
I found my holy grail of skin care. This scrub is so effective in resurfacing and exfoliation. When combined with my Vichy mineral 88 and ROC retinol cream I get results. My skin is firmer and looks more taut. I'm 64 and have combination skin. M y skin looks amazing for myage  and I get compliments on it. I ordered the smaller one to see if I like it and I will be ordering the larger o e next time. It only takes a small amount of product so I think it will last a long time.  Yes it's not cheap but you get what you pay for in this case.
Great product
"Feels and smells like it has a large percentage of cinnamon essential oil in it. Large by essential oil standards anyway.It feels unsafe on my skin. Makes it sensitive and tender right away.Cinnamon is a pretty strong and irritating essential oil and having dabbled in cosmetic formula myself I am baffled by why they would include it. I use 2% cinnamon eo in a carrier oil for a pain rub, which is about the maximum % I ever see recommended for such an oil and this feels Way way way stronger than that.Maybe if it stings you will have the belief that it's a stronger exfoliating product??Anyway I just can't get over feeling that it's an irresponsible inclusion in the formula. Even if it would still sting me without it (and I don't have sensitive skin normally) because of the chemical exfoliant ingredients, STILL why would you add any of an irritating ingredient like cinnamon eo on top of that? Makes no sense to me."
It’s  One of the best exfoliating  product with reasonable  price
Love the smell and ease of this product. Although expensive it lasts a long time
Worth every penny. If used correctly this is a must have for every skincare regime. My skin is glowing
Just irritates the skin. Really don’t  understand why this product is so hyped up.
"Acheté suite aux commentaires de Caroline receveur . Chauffe le visage ,exfolie et rend la peau douce avec une odeur style feuille de spa . Je le fais rarement car c’est un bon produit mais le prix est élevé pour ce p’tit tube"
"I love this exfoliator! I'm a licensed esthetician and this is my go to for my own skin. A little goes a long way. Make sure you dampen your skin and apply sparingly, then massage. I will feel a bit warm, then rinse with warm water and then follow with a cool rinse. Pat dry and you're ready for a hydrating mask. ;-)"
I have loved this product for years. It’s a little surprising how warm it gets when you use it the first couple of times but it doesn’t burn your skin. It exfoliates super well and leaves it feeling moisturized even with the exfoliation.
An excellent exfoliating scrub. It definitely smooths and brightens. Very light fragrance is most natural and pleasant.
The product arrived on time and was exactly what I was looking for.
"I purchased this product after reading all of the 5-star reviews, and to be honest, it's good, but in my opinion, it's not absolute best.When I first applied the product to my skin, I wasn't expecting the warming sensation that followed.  That caught me a bit off-guard.This should be used on lightly damp skin for maximum effect.  Using it in the shower will lessen the exfoliating effect.I have tried a lot of facial exfoliators and most of them are average (at best) or they just don't work.  Mary Kay TimeWise Microdermabrasion Step 1: Refine is the one I personally recommend.  I'm open to trying new products, but I always go back to Mary Kay.  It works the best for me."
"I’ve been a dedicated Dermalogica user for over 10 years, I’ve tried most of their products. During the summer I have dry skin and need some extra help with exfoliation. I usually use their microfoliant, also a great product. I wanted something less messy and gave this a try, love it! It gets into the corners of your nose really well and the warming sensation is great!"
"When I worked in the spa, we had the professional version of this. My skin was glowy. I bought this and use it in my shower every couple of days for as part of my mini facial"
Granules are small enough to not cause damage but large enough to do a proper exfoliation
Super
I have just ordered 3 more of this so I never run.out..Best product I have ever used....i used post washing my face on dry skin...my skin is actually glowing....I've spent hundreds of pounds on face products that don't work.Best facial exfoliating I purchased and I'm 57...Will never use another exfoliating produce again....
"Fait le job sans problème, peau nickel !"
"Excellent cleanser and exfoliating wash! Can be used every day if required.  Smells great and leaves skin so soft, clean and hydrated. My son, 21, and my daughter, 22, both use it as well as my husband.  Just a really great product for year round."
"The product was fantastic, works v well"
"I have very sensitive skin so I’ve chosen this exfoliating cleanser to use for my legs, and the tiny little bumps I had from clogged hair follicles ? Gone ! My skin is so soft, the in-depth exfoliating reaaally works and is not rough to use at all, not like though rough-grain ones that irritate the skin so much. I recommend !"
Great to exfoliate your skin. Face feels really clean after use.  I love it.
"Wow. I have been trying pretty much everything from physically trying to slough off dead skin from my face with various sponges to acid creams that stay on the face and supposedly dissolve dead, flaky skin. I have never seen anything work as well as this stuff does.First of all, I have fairly sensitive skin and using it a few times a week has not been a problem at all.Secondly, a little goes a very long way, so this ought to last a while, making it a great value.I follow the instructions and spend a couple of minutes massaging it into my face in a circular motion. I also use it on my neck and chest. When I'm done my skin is so smooth it's ridiculous....and I'm 62 years old.It is exfoliating and toning, but it is not moisturizing, so follow it up with a good quality moisturizer and you'll absolutely glow.After all these years of searching, eureka..... I have found it."
I’ve been using this product for almost 6 months and my skin is so clear!
I don’t write reviews but this product is definitely worth writing one. Skin is glowing from it.
Love the slight exfoliation! Nice clean feel!
I've used it for years....my granddaughter had a bad breakout so I bought one for her too.  She loves it seem to clear up her breakout in a week or so!
"My face looks so shiny and polished and not tight, painful or burning. Unlike any other exfoliate I’ve tried. I really hope this product is never discontinued. I’ve never used an exfoliant that has this much pay off without like giving me basically a chemical burn. I have such sensitive/reactive skin and I’m using topical spironolactone, tretinoin and THX and this really is the only thing that helps with the peeling/shedding instead of making it worse. Very happy"
"Okay so I know the price point for this being a facial cleanser is kind of high... Yet it is absolutely worth it. My face felt EXTREMELY clean without being dried out or irritated. There are very small exfoliating particles, I could feel that they are none damaging to the skin and have simply a gentle exfoliating effect which the skin could tolerate on a daily basis. In any case, after only one use I am really satisfied and would highly recommend, sometimes it's worth it to spend just a little bit more on your self care."
"Cleanser box was torn and opened, and item just slide out of box."
Love this product.  Excellent cleanser for the skin.  I had no sensitivity or any breakout reaction to it.  Skin feels soft and really clean after use.
"I have fat deposits that have been in my face since puberty, gone within 3 weeks of using this. I have deep deposits coming up as black heads, turning into white heads, and then disappearing. A bit pricey, but it's not outrageously expensive and it works!"
"Your face feels so cleansed after using this cleanser.  I will continue buying this, as the results are wonderful."
"I bought the CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser for my partner to help with her oily scalp and the pimples on her head, and it has made a noticeable difference!Effective for Oily Scalp: My partner has a very oily scalp, and this cleanser works wonders to reduce excess oil without stripping her hair or scalp. It leaves her scalp feeling clean and refreshed after every wash.Great for Clearing Pimples: The salicylic acid in this cleanser has been a game-changer for reducing the pimples on her scalp. After a few uses, her skin looks clearer and less irritated.Gentle Yet Powerful: Even though it's effective, the cleanser is gentle on her sensitive skin. It doesn't cause any dryness or discomfort, which is a huge plus.Versatile Use: Though it’s marketed as a facial cleanser, it’s worked incredibly well for her scalp concerns, showing how versatile and beneficial this product can be.Final Thoughts: If you’re dealing with an oily scalp or scalp pimples, I highly recommend giving the CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser a try. It’s been a fantastic solution for my partner, and we’ll definitely keep using it!"
"I’ve been using the CeraVe Salicylic Acid Fragrance-Free Cleanser for a few weeks now, and I’m really impressed! It’s gentle enough for daily use, even on my sensitive skin, but it still provides a deep cleanse. The salicylic acid helps keep my pores clear and has noticeably reduced breakouts without drying out my skin.One of my favorite things about this cleanser is that it’s fragrance-free, which makes it ideal for anyone with sensitive skin or who prefers products without strong scents. It also contains ceramides, which leave my skin feeling soft and hydrated after every wash.If you’re looking for a mild yet effective cleanser that helps with acne and leaves your skin feeling smooth, I highly recommend giving this a try. It’s become a staple in my skincare routine!"
"I did a lot of Dr. googling to figure out what would be the most direct (and affordable) route to help with my hyperpigmentation, acne scarring, and  terrible skin texture.The answer was always salicylic acid.I’ve done that loads of times in the past—for decades— and it makes my skin absolutely freak out.It would feel sensitive to the touch, like a sun burn, and peel NON. STOP.Even with twice a week usage, SAcid makes my skin soo peeely I cannot use foundation or powder— and any less than twice a week is useless for SAcid.Anyone who has terrible acne scarring understands that’s simply not OK.I need my full coverage. Thxbye.One awesome YouTuber suggested that I try this product instead of leave-on topicals.🤯This way I’m still getting the benefits using it everyday, even twice a day, however I’m not a flake monster because it’s not being left on my skin.🤯 bruh. So simple. Why didn’t I think of this????????This is just a really great cleanser. Im legit shocked every damn time I use it.The GA also leaves your skin feeling like you've had a moisturizing mask on for an hour!?! After one wash??!?Overall it’s a freaking GREAT product.It’s a lot of product.It’s super affordable. I’m not even an inch down and I use it twice a day for the past three weeks. I also wash my face twice at night so Im using more product than you’d normally use (full coverage makeup)I think I’ve finally found my forever face wash.The other one I enjoy using if I don’t have make up on is the “fresh“ soy face cleanser. But good lordt it’s expensive and doesn’t remove makeup thoroughly.If they made THIS stuff smell like THAT stuff?I’d but a vat. Two vats. To go.A surprising 10/10.If you’re wondering if you should take a gamble or not, look at the price and read the reviews. Then purchase your amazon cart you’ve sat on for a week or two.Yolo.Buy the cute jars for your spices.Get the sexy pumps.And above all else, BUY THIS FACE WASH.It’s a brand name that every GD dermatologist has suggested to me. And Ive seen a lot of them. I’m just gonna have to get over the fact that my face doesn’t smell like fresh produceButTLDR:my SKIN. IS IMPROVING. For UNDER TEN DOLLARS.Priceless."
Bough the product because I started breaking out and I’ve had this for one week using both morning and evening and so far I am very happy with my results.. skin feels very smooth and looks vibrant
"Thi is my 2nd bottle. I bought the second one because I loved it. I have combination skin. My T-zone is oily and the other parts are dry.I moisturize my skin after use.If it is not moisturized, it can dry the skin.I do not recommend it to those with dry skin.It is also very good at removing make-up.The product is right in its claim about repairing the skin.I think it is successful in reducing the texture of the face and post blemish spots . It does not reduce 100%, but it helps to make an improvement.I use it once every morning and I have used 1 box in 1 year .Pump is nice and liquid is foaming really well."
"I usually buy the CeraVe cream to foam cleanser. It removes makeup really well and moisturizes my sensitive skin without irritating it.This SA cleanser was on lightning deal so I bought it. I am using it for my neck chest arms etc. it is doing a fantastic job of smoothing and softening my older skin. I am very pleased with it. I have rosacea and sensitive facial skin so I have sparingly used it on days when I haven't worn makeup. It hasn't really irritated my face but I think using it on my face more than once a week it could. But I haven't experienced that yet. Anyway, it's a good product and does what it is supposed to do. I am pleased. CeraVe is a fantastic skin line."
"I love this cleanser during the 2020 lockdown a lot of us lady started getting into skin care because we had so much time to start truly investing in our selves. this cleanser leaves, my skin soft, does not cause dryness, does foam!! And the pump works as it should. this cleanser is a water based cleanser so no oil if you deal with acne!! The texture is perfect and overall my favorite product when washing my face!!"
"Yo tenía muchos puntos negros que me empezaron a salir hasta en los cachetes, llevo aproximadamente 2 semanas usándolo y veo una mejora, mi piel ya no tiene puntos negros y mi cara está lisita!"
"As soon as the weather got warmer my face started breaking out like crazy.  More than usual.  As soon as I started using this cleanser in combination with a sunscreen moisturizer (cetaphil oil control), cerave retinol serum, I saw results within days. Mind you I haven't used a cleanser or any products on a regular basis for years, so it was probably just newbie gains. But so far so good. I also use cerave acne foaming cleanser behind my ears where I get painful cystic acne and that appears to be working too. I just picked up cerave PM moisturizer and am adding that to my routine. This SA cleanser is good for my mild acne on my face. If you have a more sever case I would use the cerave acne foaming cleanser 4% benzoyl peroxide. But make sure to moisturize cuz it will dry you out."
انصحكم فيه معتمد من سنين
Easy to use and excellent quality
Dopo l'uso ho sentito la pella morbida e pulita👏👏
although this product has to be gritty to work it still makes skin feel smooth and soft once winced off the face.
What I like is my skin is glowing after I use the cleanser.
Really helps with exfoliation. It doesn’t irritate sensitive skin. It gets warm to the touch in the beginning so don’t be surprised or worried. The granulated product is fine like sand so does well on cleaning your small pores. Skin looks really polished.
Works nice smell good product
Definitely incorporated this in my weekly routine and I noticed a major difference
I use this product all the time after washing my face. Really helps clean my pores and smooths my face.
Love this stuff!
The contents were hard and no longer grainy. I tried to mash it up but that didn't work well.  You can see the difference in the photo.  My current product is a blue color and easily spreadable.  I will not buy from this seller again.
"Me encanto, este exfoliante es grado médico y es súper bueno y recomendado un poco elevado el precio pero Amazon siempre está en búsqueda de darnos precios accesibles, me encanta una vez cada 15 días en la piel y llego en buenas condiciones."
I have been using this for the past 20 years. It’s long lasting you only need a dab I am a 66 year old woman with very very few wrinkles.
There is no scrub like this. Its pricey but your skin will feel so soft and clean.
"It could be harsh to scrub the face , donit slowly and gently coz it could cause an abrasion on your skin"
"Tiene un olor relajante, hace un excelente dermoabrasion. Vale la pena"
"This is my second time purchasing these towel length, exfoliating wash cloths. I love how sudsy they get from the smallest amount of soap. I especially like these because they are longer than others that I have purchased and they wash well in the washing machine. I bought more because they have been washed A LOT and I snagged one, so I had to get more in case the snag turns into a hole."
"Love the exfoliation quality of this product. The softer one is great to use on my face a couple of times a week. They do have a smell to them so i always soak in Dawn dish soap before using the first time. Great for travel, dries fast and lathers beautifully."
It's a two pack and so far I have only used the gentler washcloth. It feels good on my sensitive skin and I haven't noticed any irritation. It rinses easily after use and seems very durable. The only negatives are that it is quite long and my shower space is quite small so sometimes I am hitting the shower walls while trying to pull the cloth back and forth over my back. I ordered a lotion applicator too which is shorter and has a handle at both ends and is much easier to use. The other negative is that the cloth is black and grey striped and looks like a winter scarf hanging in my shower-not too attractive!
These 2 towels have a rough and the other a less aggressive texture.They are very long and work well.Very pleased
"I'm a young, disabled, plus size woman. Due to my disabilities I can't reach my back, lower legs, or feet very well. I used the ""softer"" cloth for my back and face. I used the ""harsher"" cloth for my legs and feet. This is literally life changing for me. Now I can finally shower without assistance again! I can use these to wrap around parts of me - including between the toes! - and really scrub them clean. I cannot even express how much this means to me. Any product I can find to give me back some of my independence is welcome and well worth the price. Not that these are expensive. They really, really aren't. Obviously, these aren't the only disability-friendly part of our bathroom set up, but it's now a permanent one. So simple, but none of my doctors here in the USA suggested these. They said use those brush or luffa on a stick to reach the hard to get to areas. Those are not a good disability-friendly option. Just holding the stick is a challenge for me due to my nerve damage and arthritis in the hands, but add soap and the thing jumps right out of my grasp and has even tripped me before. I'm already at plenty risk for slips and falls without adding a soapy, bamboo stick to the equation. Other options like scrubby gloves don't help me since I can't reach certain parts of myself. I can't bend and twist like a typical healthy person. I can wrap these towels around my hands so that they don't easily slip through my fingers. This had been the product missing from my shower lineup. I will be telling all my doctors about these, so that they can suggest them to others who have movement disabilities. They are exfoliating so keep that in mind if you have sensitive skin. I'd only suggest using the ""harsher"" cloth on the body and not the face."
"I bought these to help with exfoliating my whole body, specifically my back, and the backs of my legs, where my skin gets very dry (because I can't reach it with my wrist issues).I like the length of these, but they are very thin, which means they don't hold on to soap/exfoliating. It all just drips off (maybe I'm doing it wrong?).The two levels of roughness are okay, and they look quite pretty, but they're not effective for me. YMMV.That said, the price was good, so I'm not mad. I just wish they were a bit more substantial."
"I have tried similar washcloths but I like this one best because it's longer and easier to reach around to scrub your back, etc. Easy to clean and dry for reuse. I mainly use the rougher exfoliating towel as it's just the right amount of roughness to really exfoliate and clean your skin. Would definitely buy again."
"Theses towels are awesome! They don't look like much, but if you fold them up to wet them and then lather them up with body wash, they REALLY lather up well with less body wash. I wanted something to ""scrub"" my back because it always itches, and these work perfectly, but are also great everywhere else as well. I would highly recommend these!"
It is effective in removing the old skins that you would otherwise have a hard time to reach. Easy and effective. It's nice to feel the smooth skin after robbing your back with this product. You will feel less itching in days to come.
"Muy bien, las toallas son de buen tamaño, las indicaciones si corresponde al producto."
Me resulta muy como su uso al poder plegarse o desplegarse a conveniencia facilitando la sensación de limpiezaEl paño más abrasivo te deja una sensación de limpieza sin irritación o molestias.Satisfecho con la adquisición.
Doux et très efficace
"Funktioniert sehr gut, man spürt deutlich den Unterschied zwischen den zwei verschieden rauen Bändern.Man muss nur darauf achten, dass das Band von Anfang an flach am Rücken aufliegt, ansonsten faltet es sich zu einem runden Strang zusammen.Ein wirklich praktisches Teil zur Rückenpflege, das auch zusammengeknüllt oder um die Hand gewickelt anders verwendet werden kann.Auch positiv: Trocknet in 3-4 Stunden in der Wohnung."
"I’ve been using the Differin Face Scrub Daily Brightening Exfoliator for a few weeks now, and I’m really impressed with the results, especially for the price point. It’s a gentle exfoliator that leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed without being too harsh or abrasive.What sets this apart from other scrubs I’ve tried is how it brightens my skin while keeping it hydrated. A lot of exfoliators tend to dry out my skin, but Differin strikes the perfect balance between exfoliating and moisturizing. I’ve noticed my complexion looks more even, and my skin feels softer after each use.The best part? The value. For a product that’s this effective and lasts as long as it does, the price is absolutely worth it. A little goes a long way, so one tube lasts quite a while. I also love that it’s non-irritating and works well with my sensitive skin.If you're looking for a daily exfoliator that brightens and smooths without breaking the bank, I highly recommend giving this one a try. It’s a great addition to any skincare routine!"
"I have a face only a monkey could love.  That's what my wife would always tell me.  I knew i needed some sort of remedy to improve my facial appearance.  Eventually I found this facial scrub and ever since i started using it, my wife can now finally look at me again.  Thanks to Differin, my wife withdrew the divorce papers and her bf is now living with us in our home.  I still have to sleep on the couch alone, but that beats sleeping out on the streets. We're one big happy family. Thanks Differin!"
I purchased this scrub for my daughter who has acne. But she didn't use it so I decided to use it instead. The scrub's really gentle and it's not gritty. It makes my skin clean and feeling smooth. I would recommend it to anyone.
I have been using this product for several months but just recently purchased through Amazon. The Brightening Exfoliator leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed with no irritation. I recommend using only once per day or every other day (I use it nightly) as it may dry out skin. Definitely use a good moisturizer after. My skin tone and texture is brighter and more even when I use it regularly.
"I use to pay lots of 💰💰 for my facial products, but my dermatologist recommended trying Differin and k absolutely love it! My skin feels amazing and works just as good as the expensive products on the market!!"
"I was hopeful to try this as I have heard good things about this brand. However, I am not a fan of this product. I still get acne and I did not notice any ""brightening"" or improvements in tone and texture. Waste of money in my opinion."
This is super gentle and doesn’t leave my skin feeling rough. It feels so soft afterwards. I use it every night & will continue to. It helps get rid of my peeling on my face with tretinoin use.
"I’ve been using this for two years, I love the product, great for exfoliating and for daily use. It’s not super harsh and my skin is left soft and very smooth, I get alot of compliments about it. It has lightened some of my dark spots too with time but it’s nothing super drastic."
"I purchased the bergamot mint scrub because those are two of my favorite scents. The mint is more dominant, but it just smells so good and refreshing. I prefer salt scrubs over sugar scrubs. I used to purchase one from the department store, but this one is less expensive and just as good.The Bare Botanics' scrub was packed nicely in a cute box and came with a little wooden spoon. There was a note included, which is a nice touch. I couldn't wait to try the produce once opening the jar because the smell was divine. It left my skin so soft. I used it on my elbows and knees, and the felt so much softer afterwards. This is my new favorite scrub, and I will definitely purchase it again and again!"
This scrub is literally the best thing I've ever used in the shower! It's great for an everything shower and it makes my skin extremely soft! I will be buying again!
I was in search of a new salt body scrub and came across this one. I purchased the unscented option because I don’t usually like perfume smells all that much. When I tried it for the first time it worked amazing. But for me I feel that there is too much oil  and it just sticks on my body. I don’t mind it too much considering that I rub the oil on my skin and then I lightly scrub it off with a body wash.Other than all the excess oil it really does exfoliate and soften your skin pretty well.
"This is my favorite scrub ever. Thick and doesn’t dissolve quickly which I love, the only negative is I wish they would have bigger portions so I can stock up!"
Easy to use Smells good
"I like the consistency of the body scrub, and the fact that I can add body wash to it and apply to my skin to remove dead skin ."
"Is what you’ll be doing if you use this. Was a pleasant product, but you’ll have to clean your tub or shower each time. It coats everything. Makes the tub slick and unsafe. I’m gonna stick with simple baking soda to soften an exfoliate areas and he’s a nice thick Cerve cream. Not going to return it, but not sure that I’ll use it. This is one of those quandary products."
"First, amazing that they are cruelty-free… THANK YOU! I chose the fragrance free option and adore it. Its satisfying to use, I can feel my skin & circulation waking up and rejuvenating while I massage off the dead skin. I was looking for natural ingredient, yet extremely well at exfoliating…while moisturizing… (nearly defeated from past selections) but I finally found this prize and I am so thankful ❤️ checked all my boxes and more"
I was quite excited to try this product base off of all the reviews and I can say it lives up to the hype. It exfoliate wonderful scent is not overwhelming and the oils is balance not too greasy or drying either. Definitely will purchase again.
Great product!!!!!
Makes the skin really soft and smells sooo good. I'll definitely order again.
"Firstly, this scrub is way bigger than the preview image, it lasted me 6 months! At first it was extremely hard to open but after a while i just go to used to not properly re sealing it after using it so it was easy to open again the next time. When i originally bought it, it was way cheaper so unfortunately i will not be repurchasing due to the increase in price. However, I must say that i scraped every single ml out of the tub as it was very much like liquid gold to me. Thet ingredients are amazing, and it makes lotion not necessary after using. Smells divine and is great to use before you shave. Also, if you struggle with body acne this is great!"
"I'll be purchasing this again, absolutely love the Eucalyptus smell, and the scrub works sooo well on my feet, leaving them very soft and smooth after one use."
I could not get over how delicious this smelled. I would love this as a full body scrub or body wash. It worked so well and my skin felt baby soft.
I really like this scrub. It has helped clear up some ingrown and I can tell a difference in my skin as well.
"I switched to this scrub to try something different. (Felt my prev. scrub was only, ok.) I like this scrub so far, I feel like it is coarse enough to do it’s job. The smell is not my favorite but it’s tolerable. My only cons are: it can be a little messy and it can be hard to scoop out of the container."
"This along with wizker exfoliating brush have been a game changer. I have not had any ingrown hairs in a year and I'm very prone to them. Not to mention it smells divine, like seriously it smells so delicious and it makes my skin feels amazing afterwards."
I love the smell and i’m super sensitive to scented products but this left no rash. didn’t help w the ingrown hairs but feels soft after
"This is a bath must-have! It has a great smell, very fruity like pomegranate. I feel like I'm living my best life with this, as it dissolves easily and feels really soft in my hands! It has almost a spongey texture, not beads that could scratch the skin, but almost like a paste that can be spread on to sit on the skin or be rubbed in to exfoliate. Love it!"
It does indeed make your skin so soft. It also smells amazing!
"Impressed with ingredients used and can be used with underarms, knees and elbows too."
Perfect
"I love the idea of this scrub. I minused a star because it dissolves so quickly that I wonder how much it can actually being scrubbing.Other than that, it smells amazing, is gentle (no adverse reaction), and comes in a good sized container."
"I have thick oily skin so when I get breakouts they last for a while, this has helped to clear up my face very well."
It feels really refreshing and clean
"Works OK, nothing special"
"Its ability to thoroughly clean without leaving my skin feeling stripped or dry is one of my favorite things about it. I don't feel constricted or uncomfortable after, but my pores seem cleaner. I've found that it helps keep any oiliness at away during the day, especially in my T-zone, and it's moderate enough to apply every day. It's also simple to rinse off, which is fantastic. This exfoliating scrub rinses clean, leaving my skin feeling smooth and non-greasy, unlike some that cling to the skin long after washing. Its lack of oil helps keep my skin balanced throughout the day, which is something else I like about it. Additionally, the recipe appears to balance hydration. Compared to previous washes I've used, my skin feels hydrated and I've seen less irritation or redness. But I did discover that, particularly when I'm pressed for time, it can require a little more work to thoroughly rinse off the exfoliating beads. All in all, I now always use this cleanser in my routine. It is mild and nutritious to my skin, but it also leaves me feeling really clean. It keeps my skin clear and silky and is a nice way to start and finish the day."
The price and value are on point. The quality of this facial cleanser and exfoliated are good and gentle. My 13 year old loves this
It is very safe and easy to use. I like the scrub function in my soft soap. Easy to clean. No allergy.
"I love this cleanser for two major reasons:  It has no menthol stuff in it which tends to irritate my eyes and,  #2, it leaves a nice matte finish on my skin after washing and rinsing.  It has a mild scent which is also a good thing.  I highly recommend this cleanser."
"Okay the 1st picture is of one of the Best or was the Best Deep Action Face Exfoliating scrub. I used it for years it was always good at exfoliating my face, I have severe flaking skin on my face this was great at removing the flaking and dead skin.  Unfortunately a short while ago Clean and Clear changed the formula I guess to be "" Vegan"" it's a shame the new formula isn't a SCRUB it's a so called Cleanser and it isn't good and does nothing to remove dead skin or Exfoliate anymore. So i have had to look to find an actual Exfoliating Face Scrub again after wasting money on a few other brands I think I've finally found a solid replacement from Neutrogena it works nice at Exfoliating and it doesn't burn or dry the skin 👍. Unfortunately I can't recommend Clean and Clear Exfoliating Cleanser its no longer a Scrub and the company needs to bring back the Original."
Me encantó
"Exelente producto, y a muy buen precio lo recomiendo 👍"

"Lo utilizo desde hace años , por ahora no puedo viajar a USA para comprarlo ya que es más económico y lo encuentras en diferentes sitios.En línea su precio aumenta plus el envío.Lo bueno es que es la versión value size (198 gr)"
Solo me llegaron dos productosOjalá y  me lo repongan
I have been using this product for years in combination with the moisturizers. It leaves my face feeling so clean and fresh. Will definitely be buying this again!
Great product!!
I like this product for exfoliating and only need to use sparingly and not everyday. It’s really good if you want to clean out pores. It’s not irritating on sensitive skin.
Product does exactly as advertised
Nice product
This OZ face wash makes your skin so incredibly clean and fresh feeling. Amazing!!
Great product. Great price
"The ZO Skin Health Exfoliating Cleanser is a game-changer in my skincare routine! This phenomenal product does exactly what it claims and more.Firstly, it's a powerhouse in removing dirt and surface oil, leaving my skin feeling incredibly clean and refreshed after every use. The exfoliation properties are remarkable; it unclogs pores like a charm, giving my skin a smoother, more refined texture.What truly sets this cleanser apart is its ability to soothe and calm irritated skin. As someone with occasional sensitivity, this product has been a savior. It gently exfoliates without causing any discomfort, and the calming effect is noticeable immediately after use.The formula feels luxurious and indulgent, yet it's effective without being harsh. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall appearance of my skin since incorporating this cleanser into my routine. It's helped reduce blemishes and even out my complexion, giving me that coveted healthy glow.Furthermore, a little goes a long way with this product, making it a cost-effective addition to my skincare regimen.If you're looking for a cleanser that not only deeply cleans but also soothes and revitalizes your skin, the ZO Skin Health Exfoliating Cleanser is an absolute must-try. My skin has never looked or felt better, and I couldn't be happier with the results!"""
Va muy bien para el acné
"i ave been using this for a year, it does the job"
Had to report parcel damage and was for a gift great at customer service but had to report delivery people for repeated bad packaging some of which was covered in grease
It didn't clean up face instead made it worse. Be careful!
The package arrived late and in a ripped up condition
"Okay, let’s talk about these little magic discs of Vitamin C goodness! If you’re looking to even out your skin tone and tackle those stubborn dark spots caused by sun damage or acne scars, Medicube Deep Vita C Facial Pads might just become your new best friend. 🧡The Good Stuff:Dark Spots, Begone! These pads have seriously helped fade my sun spots and acne scars after a few weeks of use. I noticed my skin looking brighter and more even, which was exactly what I was hoping for.Dual-sided Design: One side is textured for gentle exfoliation (kind of like a mini facial scrub), and the other is smoother for a softer finish. I love that versatility — it’s like a mini spa treatment in a pad.Fragrance-Free Glory: I really appreciate that there’s minimal fragrance here. No overpowering scents, just pure Vitamin C goodness doing its job!Proceed with Caution, Sensitive Skin Friends:If you have sensitive skin like me, just a quick heads up: don’t go overboard! These pads pack a potent punch, and using them daily could lead to irritation (learned that the hard way). I found that using them every other night was the sweet spot — it gave my skin time to adjust without freaking out. Also, expect a little bit of a burn if you’re not used to Vitamin C this strong. It’s not unbearable, but you’ll feel the tingle for sure.The Results:Smooth, bright skin after day one? Check! Fewer breakouts and overall improved skin texture with continued use? Double check! These pads have definitely earned a spot in my nighttime routine, though I’d say less is more if your skin is on the sensitive side.Final Thoughts:Great for tackling uneven skin tone and scarring, but sensitive skin peeps, use with caution. With the right balance, these pads can leave your skin glowing like a ray of sunshine... but be sure to not go overboard!Would definitely recommend — just remember: moderation is key. 🌟"
"I used to use the Aveeno version of this item long ago when I used to “borrow” my mother’s cosmetics products. I loved how simple it was, since it provided exfoliation and toning at the same time. So when my skin started suffering from PCOS, and I started complaining about larger pores, I think Alexa heard me - So I was recommended this product. I decided to try it.I used this product for the first time this morning And was pleasantly surprised. There is barely a smell – what I do smell is closer to a slight alcohol pad smell. It did not dry out my skin, which is super important since I suffer from dry skin. I also did not have a sensitivity reaction to it. I felt like it did a good job cleaning and slightly smoothing out my skin. I’ll keep using them and hope that it helps with my pores which have gotten larger from PCOS. Damn that testosterone! Hopefully these help :-)"
Medicube you have done it again!! As I'm getting older I'm finding that my pores are becoming much more prominent. I've tried several different products over the last few years to try and combat the problem but I've gotten little to no results and some of them have been quite harsh on my skin which can be sensitive but Medicube's Zero Pore Pads are absolutely what I have been searching for!! Since I've started using these pads my pores are really tightening up for me. My skin looks and feels so much better and my makeup lays better on my skin and wears better through the day. My pores are definitely looking smaller and the amount of sebum produced is considerably less as well.Let me just say that Medicube is quickly becoming one of my absolute favorite skincare brands out there. I own several of their products and not one has disappointed. My skin looks and feels better than it has in years. I get comments all the time telling me how radiant and beautiful my skin looks and let me tell you that is not something I was ever used to before. I really can't believe how much better my skin is since I've been using their products. I will continue to be a Medicube customer because I feel good giving them my money since I know I will get the results I am looking for.10/10 highly recommend!!
"I absolutely love these pads! They are super convenient, soaked with plenty of liquid, and feature a smooth side and a lightly textured side. I experienced no irritation, but to be fair, I generally don’t have issues with vitamin C. However, I often avoid using it in the morning because I haven’t found one that works well with makeup, isn’t sticky, or doesn’t leave my face slightly orange. I’ve tried brands like SkinCeuticals, Truth Serum, Osmosis, and Timeless, but none fit seamlessly into my routine.The only thing I can’t speak to yet is whether this product actually delivers results, which is why I left one star off. If it works, it’s a 10-star product!"
"I got this product because I have large sebaceous filaments in my nose that I was tired of using pore strips for. The pore strips helped but they would come back quickly so I decided to pick up these pore pads to help tackle the issue. I have noticed a big difference in how my pores look within two weeks of using this product. My makeup looks more smooth and nose less bumpy. I would recommend gently exfoliating as well with this product since it can cause light peeling since it's removing old skin. This product isn't too harsh since I have sensitive skin and haven't had any issues.  Overall,  I would recommend this product for someone looking to reduce the size of their pores."
"Review of Medicube Zero Pore PadsI recently tried the Medicube Zero Pore Pads, and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The pads are saturated with a gentle exfoliating solution that effectively removes impurities and excess oil without causing irritation.The texture of the pads is perfect for a thorough cleanse, and they left my skin feeling refreshed and smooth. I noticed a visible reduction in the appearance of my pores, which is a huge plus. They’re also incredibly easy to use, just swipe and go!Overall, I highly recommend Medicube Zero Pore Pads for anyone looking to enhance their skincare routine."
"Die besten Toner Pads, habe nach einer Woche Verwendung schon Unterschiede auf der Nase und den Wangen bemerkt. Die Haut wirkt reiner, da die Poren rein und geschlossen sind."
"Resserre les pores de ouf, lisse la peau vraiment trop bien"
شفت مدح عليه وقررت اجربه ما استخدمته لوجهي بس للابط لاني كنت بختبر شيء وحده قالت اذا عندك اثار اسمرار من شيء بيروحها وانا كانت عندي بقعه ومررره خففها باقي مستمره عليه وكمية المنتج تستاهل السعر يقشر بشكل خفيف بدون اي تحسس وينعم
I have a Korean friend who recommended this brand to me. So I decided to try these toner pads - I’m so impressed. I used to have blackheads and my nose was a bit flakey which was always difficult wearing foundation or tinted skincare.  These have completely got rid of this without using a harsh exfoliater as my skin is quite sensitive. They are also so refreshing on my skin - would recommend and will use again for sure 😁😁😁
"prodotto che offre qualità sia per il contenitore,sia per i tanti dischetti.a me personalmente pulisce il viso,ma non ho notato miglioramenti nei pori se non il minimo, quindi al loro termine dubito di riprenderli per il prezzo ."
"Used the cirrus scrub immediately upon receipt.  Very effective and left my skin silky smooth.  I have been paying unseen amount for name brand sugar scrubs and for less quantity,  I am so happy I found these scrubs.  The scents are wonderful - not overpowering but most of all very effective.  I hope Amazon keeps offering these in the future.  I highly recommend"
Love this product. I have sensitive skin that often gets itchy with heavy fragrance. No issues w this scrub. I use it in the shower before shaving and my legs feel so soft and smooth!
I am on like my 3rd round of these. They are my favorite scent and its the perfect texture for an everyday scrub in rough areas.
Sold just like advertised in the photo
Great set
The sugar scrub is nice. The shea butter scent is not what I thought it was going to be. I really thought you would be able to smell it more but over all good quality.
Great for all over body exfoliating
I absolutely love this scrub. It smells and feels great on my skin. I gift this to all my gal pals too. Great value on this set of 3!
منتاز.. سعر جيد
Very disappointed. Wasn't wrapped well and the cap was broken. I tried the scrub and it smelled super fake. Won't buy ever again.
No expiry date
"I have been using Burt’s Bees lip balm for actual decades now and it’s great. It does have a little minty tingle when first applied that I personally like and it glides on easy. It’s not sticky or drying like some other products, just a nice basic everyday lip balm. I’ve tried other lip balms over the years but always come back to the OG Burt’s Bees. It’s also super affordable so I always buy the multipacks so I can have one in my bag and a couple stashed around the house."
If I could I would give this product 100000 stars for a rating . This is my all time favorite chap stick/ lip balm to go to. Always leaves my lips feeling moist and hydrated. I also LOVE the scent of it . Worth the money ❤️
"I mean this is like your phone, I cant leave home without it, PERIOD! I only rock with this brand, and this deal is the best! I will never go to CVS or where ever and pay almost 6 bucks for 1. I get this like clock work every 4 months. Last, good quality, i def recommend."
My favorite chapstick. I can’t live without it. I order a 4 pack monthly.
This is our whole family’s go to for chapped lip care. One application and there’s definitely a difference in healing. Also perfect for chapped lip prevention. We trust Burt’s Bees.
I've been using Burt's bee wax lip balm for years now and I've been purchasing the 4 pack for a while with my subscription service. The lip balm is great as usual but I noticed that the latest order that the container was redesigned. The cap most specifically is made from a thinner material.I realized the other day that the cap cracked and came off the body and the lip balm got all inside my pocket.Everything is else is great except for the new cap design.
Burts Bees is my absolute favourite! Works immediately - I always have a tube on me!
My lips are always dry. I carry one of these where ever I go. Great Product!
Just great
Very rarely do I give something a 5-star review. If you have not used Burt's Bees Beeswax Lip Balm you are missing out. Fabulous long-lasting pepperminty tingle. Keeps lips moisturized. I've been using this for decades. I have one in every purse lol!
It smells like mango butter. Or at least I'm guessing that's what the foul smell is. Not a hint of mango smell at all. Whxih is quite different from the other pack 4 pack I bought.  Those smelt amazing. Plus the packaging was all messed up and I had to return it as it felt like it was old product. Not happy with burts bees as I was looking forward to a really good mango smelling lip balm.
Good product. Great price and fast shipment
Good product! Burtsbees is thr best lipbalm little pricey but worth the penny
"These are a constant repurchase for me. I absolutely HATE the original liquid Aquaphor (and any liquid lip balm) but these are great. I have these in every work bag, backpack, car and dresser I have. I go through them pretty quick but they don’t leave your lips shiny or greasy (as a man this is important)."
I bought the stick to help fill in the lines to my upper lip prior to foundation.  Not sure yet if it makes a difference or not but it sure is great relief for chart lips at a football game.
"Lo compre porque me lo recomendaron y no me arrepiento, dura mucho y cura los labios // I bought it because it was recommended to me and I do not regret it, it lasts long and heals the lips."
"This product is not only a super long lasting lip balm, but:- I keep a tube with my manicure kit, I use it to moisturize my cuticles.-I saw a MUA use it (straight from the tube) as an undereye primer, before concealer. It worked great, no creasing.-We use it to soothe irritated noses when we have colds.-I use it on any random facial dry patches."
"I have enjoyed Aquaphor products, mainly their hand moisturizer, so I thought I would try out their lip balm. I used to live in a humid environment where I never had to use lip moisturizer but currently I live in a dry environment. For me, I like to have some moisture on my lips otherwise it feels uncomfortable but I never get dried out where they begin to crack. Normally I apply the original chapstick about 4 times a day because my lips get dried out regularly. So far for this product I've discovered my lips dry out sooner and have to apply on more. I believe this product could be great for recovering from chapped lips and I enjoy the clean ingredients but I still go back to the plain old ChapStick because it provides longer moisture."
"Received as described excellent packaging, excellent value, prescribed by the doctor, ease of use, good results ,excellent delivery, excellent seller, would buy from them again"
"This product is the only lip care I can tolerate. No burning, only gentle care. I'm so grateful I found it."
This is the only lip balm that works for my daughter. She uses it everyday during fall & winter.
"This is a must for anyone with dry lips!  This portable lip balm is perfect to hydrate your lips with its key ingredients.  And if you’re living in a cold area, then this should be your best friends."
It’s not repair. It just prevents.
"Excelente producto, de muchos que he probado para mi este es el mejor, hidrata y deja muy suaves los labios. Lo recomiendo totalmente."
As expected and arrived quickly
"This lip balm is great. You get two for a good price, and it keeps my lips soft for a long time. It’s not sticky, and the scent is nice but not too strong. I like having one at home and one in my bag. Definitely worth it!"
"This is the best lip treatment I've found and, believe me, I""ve tried more than I care to count. The light, smooth feel is soothing and DOES help my dry, pealy  lips. For me, the tube version of Aquaphor has worked and felt much better than the stick version. Highly recommend trying it."
I've tried all the lip care products all the lip balms & all the Overnight care products. I go back to the same one because nothing is better than Aquaphor. I actually think one of the lip balm a very popular one that starts with an E was making my lips more chapped. Someone recommend I stop using that and just use Aquaphor and my lips cleared up and I am happy once again!!!!
"This is a powerhouse product that keeps lips moisturized. I like how it’s rated 100/100 on the Yuka App that rates a products quality based on the ingredients. In other words, it’s super safe and doesn’t have unhealthy ingredients like hormone disruptors. Would recommend!"
"If you don’t have a surplus of these in your home, buy some and use it all the time. It’s good for keeping your lips from cracking all winter if you use once a day!"
"My lips used to peel daily no matter what I did. I learned of a ""constant moisture"" method using Aquaphor in which I consistently applied this lip repair product throughout the day--it has been the ONLY thing I've tried that heals my lips and prevents peeling. I keep one with me everywhere. A tad pricey but worth it for what I deal with. Highly recommend! Thick and clear ointment."
"The product has a strange taste, it bothers me. It is very hydrating though"
I always use Aquaphor so thought I’d try the lip balm and def don’t regret it! It spreads well and last for HOURS. I smoke 420 and deal with chronic dried lips so this has been a LIFE SAVER!
"This is the perfect size to carry around with you where ever you go, especially if you have kids.  It is a must have."
I adore this lip balm! It’s such a lovely texture/consistency and I feel the results straight away. Works wonders on dry lips.
Aquaphor works really well. It is better than anything else I have tried.
Great moisturiser
"Bought this as other brands weren't working that well. This product is really good, will continue to use."
My lips are so soft! Good price on the 2 pack
"I discovered I am allergic to Bert's Beeswax. I had this awful red ring around my lips like I had drank red kool-aid and it was like that for months. I also couldn't figure out why my lips burned when I used it. I tried blistex and that ring is completely gone! It took a month or two to go away, but it finally did! Blistex has the least amount of irritants in the ingredients unlike Bert's Beeswax. I highly recommend Blistex"
"Blistex is the only lip balm I use and because I use it often, buying it in the pack of 3 is a great price."
"My go-to lip balm is Blistex Medicated, and I absolutely love it. The cooling effect on my lips as well as the moisture it provides, quickly make it an asset to everyday life! SPF-15 provides great protection from the sun. I keep one in my purse, my office, and my bathroom. Really good price for a 3-pack!!"
"One of the better lip balms that is currently on the market.  Pleasant mouthfeel, includes sun protection and lasts a good while."
work great - have used for years - good price
Great lip balm.
I have been using Blistex for years. it is a really good chapstick.
"These were perfect for my dry, chapped lips. It feels amazing. Bought them online because they’re cheaper, lasts long, just amazing."
Pour lèvres abîmées et fragiles … c est le meilleur !J ai pas mal d allergies et ce produit est vraiment efficace

helpful in removing darkness from lips and keeping lips hydrated for a long.
"Ainda prefiro a Burt's Bees Medicated, é mais gostosa, fica aquela sensação de menta no lábio e da uma amortecida, essa já não tem essa sensação praticamente. Mas, pela dificuldade de achar e valores da Burt's Bees, é uma excelente opção, não existe uma nacional que se compare. O lábio não fica melado, nem brilhante, e ela previne o ressecamento e ajuda na recuperação também, neste sentido é inclusive provavelmente mais eficiente que a Burt's Bees."
"Buen articulo, lo recibi conforme a lo especificado. Altamente recomendable"
"BUY IT, you won't regret it!  After purchasing some of the more expensive laneige ones, I decided to try this elf lip balm. I feel like these work so much better... and for so much less money!  I got two of them - peach & honeydew. The description says there's a sheet tint of color - I didn't find that to be true, to me they go on just like a clear balm. But I'm obsessed with the scents & the formula is non-sticky, in my opinion, just a good slick balm. Peach smells like the peach ring candies, and honeydew actually reminds me of the old B&BW scent cucumber melon. There's definitely a melon scent but it also has this ""fresh"" smell to it & the only thing I can think to compare it to is the fresh smell that cucumbers have. My teenage daughter actually stole my honeydew, so I had to come back & buy another one!Final note is that they work really well. I haven't been drinking enough water recently, so my lips were really dry. I put this on at night before going to bed & the next morning, the dryness was significantly less. And after night 3, my lips were back to ""normal"" - no dryness!I now have purchased multiples so that I can keep one on my nightstand, one at my desk & one in my purse... so I never have to be without, and at $4 a pop, why not?! A cup of coffee costs more than these little gems!"

First impressions:It has a very light strawberry scent. If you don't like overpowering scents then this will probably be good for you. It's colorless on the lips. The formula is super smooth and easy to apply I really like it. Will update this review periodically as I use it more.
"Has a rich, buttery scent and feel with a texture similar to shea butter. It goes on thicker than a chapstick but becomes slippery as it warms up. The tube is on the smaller size about that of a drugstore chapstick.I think it does well in a pinch, smells nice and adds a shimmer thats not dissimilar to vaseline or coconut oil. I dont find it particularly hydrating and doesnt hold up in comparison to something like laniege, but is much better than wax chapsticks that only dry out my lips after use. Since it reminded me of shea butter, i usually use it after putting some water or hydrating serum on my lips and it does a great job of sealing that moisture in without being as heavy as a lip oil.overall good, simple product that I would purchase again."
"I thought I bought a different brand then this ElF brand for chapped lips, and at first was disappoint when I received this.3 nights later I give this lip moisturizer a try!Omgosh I woke up to soft No chapped lips!I had been using for my very chapped lips aA pricey small $50.00 jar from Amazon or a less expensive in the tube for my dry lips, it was nice, but I never got result like this ELF,Just overnight, and No chapped lips. But I still had chapped lips from the other brand for weeks!I’m very impressed needless to say, and will be buying more for my family,  Also Makes a useful  xmas stocking stuffers , or just buy it for the kids and hubby.Yes the tube is small but it works So fast and you won’t have to use it everyday, and night.I live in California that is dryer then other states!Drinking more water also helps chapped lips, and dry skin.But this Elf is my very favorite, and Inexpensive.5 stars"
"I absolutely fell in love with the vanilla frosting squeeze me lippie - the vanilla scent is any vanilla girly dream while providing a moisturizing feeling without being sticky. I grabbed some to gift and my girlies loved them as just much as I did. I like the slanted lip applicator as well! The size is perfect to fit in your pocket, purse, backpack or car - I suggest just getting one for every location!"
Buonissimo profumo d’uva comodo da stendere anche se leggermente appiccicoso e lascia le labbra morbidissime!
"I bought the e.l.f. Squeeze Me Lip Balm in Strawberry for my daughter, and she absolutely loves it! It’s the perfect balance between a moisturizing lip balm and a sheer tint of color, making it great for her to use every day. The strawberry scent is a hit, and the balm goes on smoothly without feeling sticky or heavy.The fact that it’s infused with hyaluronic acid makes it extra hydrating, which is great for keeping her lips soft and smooth, especially in colder weather. I also love that it’s vegan and cruelty-free—it’s nice to know that it’s made with good ingredients and ethical practices.The sheer tint is subtle enough for young girls but still adds a nice pop of color that my daughter loves showing off. It’s the perfect size to fit in her bag, and she takes it everywhere!If you’re looking for a lip balm that’s fun, hydrating, and safe for kids, I definitely recommend this one! It’s become a favorite in our house."
Es richt so gut und die Lippen fühlen sich gut an.
Good product was a bit smaller then accepted
Aangename textuur en ruikt ook lekker. Niet duur
"This lip balm is extremely moisturizing. I had been using petroleum jelly and Aquaphor on my lips, and they would not really help with my dry lips. I know the price for this product is a bit on the expensive side, but a little bit goes a long way. ITtfeels very comfortable on my lips, and it doesn't feel sticky or greasy. I will definitely be buying this again."
"I absolutely love this lip balm! I have chronic dry, cracked lips, and this is the only thing that works. All other balms made my lips even more dry and worse, but this one is super hydrating and really helps repair them. I love it so much I have tubes all around the house—haha! Plus, it’s fragrance-free, which is a nice bonus. Highly recommend if you’ve struggled with dry lips like I have!"
"This lip balm is smooth & not sticky & makes my lips feel great. It does have a sweetish taste, so be aware of that, & the tube is very small, thus the 4 stars instead of 5."
"Amazing, similar to the cicaplast baum but for lips. Literally lasts 12+ hours. So happy I bought it."
"Im definitely a Burt’s bees or Vaseline girlie, I thought I’d try this because I’m getting more into skin care, but the product itself isn’t all that great, I feel like I’m constantly reapplying. It doesn’t really do much for my lips, they don’t feel any more hydrated than usual. I’m hoping the ingredients will be good for my skin however, so far haven’t seen any differences."
I have extremely sensitive skin and this product never irritates it.  Moistens it nicely .
I love this la roche posay lip product it is thick enough not to disappear on your lips and it actually conditions my lips.
"La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Lip Balm B5 has become a staple in my skincare routine, and for good reason. As someone who struggles with dry, chapped lips, I've tried numerous lip balms, but this one stands out for its exceptional moisturizing and healing properties.The texture of the Cicaplast Lip Balm B5 is smooth and creamy, gliding effortlessly onto my lips without feeling greasy or heavy. It immediately provides a soothing sensation, alleviating dryness and restoring comfort. The formula, enriched with panthenol (pro-vitamin B5) and shea butter, effectively nourishes and repairs damaged lips, promoting long-term hydration and preventing further dryness.What I appreciate most about this lip balm is its effectiveness in both protecting and repairing my lips. Whether I'm dealing with harsh weather conditions or recovering from sun exposure, it provides a reliable barrier that keeps my lips soft and supple throughout the day. It also works well as a base for lipstick, ensuring smooth application without compromising hydration.Additionally, La Roche-Posay's commitment to sensitive skin is evident in this product. The Cicaplast Lip Balm B5 is fragrance-free and hypoallergenic, making it suitable for even the most sensitive lips.Overall, La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Lip Balm B5 has earned its place as a top-tier lip care solution in my beauty arsenal. It's a must-have for anyone seeking a gentle yet effective lip balm that delivers lasting hydration and repair."
"I have tried a ton of different products for lip hydration and this one is one of my favorites to use at night. Very rich and actually moisturizes, not just provides an oily barrier like a lot of other ones I've tried."
Lo uso solo  por la noches y duermo con el producto en los labios pero si tengo de día unos labios muy resecos me aplico  un poco humecta da suavidad inmediata no tiene fragancia ni color compraré  otro para cargar en el bolso me gustó llevo un aproximado dos semanas usandolo
"Idrata bene, ha una buona consistenza e non è appiccicoso."
"Produit ayant fait ses preuves, tout à fait adapté à mes besoins"
The cream is very good but the tube is smaller than what is in the photo!!
"I’ve been using this lip balm for a few weeks now, and it does a great job at keeping my lips soft and hydrated. The texture is smooth, not too sticky, and it glides on easily. It has a pleasant, subtle scent, which I really like. However, I find myself needing to reapply it quite often throughout the day, as it wears off fairly quickly. If you don’t mind reapplying, it’s a great option for dry lips. The compact size also makes it easy to carry around in your pocket or bag. Overall, good but not long-lasting!"
My lips get really chapped and these were perfect. It does taste very good and doesn't smell great but it does what it supposed to and it also makes my lips look glossy.
"Carmex Original Flavor Moisturizing Lip Balm — I've been using Carmex for 50 years, so I have history with this product. Originally it came in a little glass jar with a metal top and I had to stick my finger inside to transfer the balm to my lips – not exactly a clean process. Nevertheless, it thoroughly protected my lips from drying up during the harshness of winters and hot dry summers. The new soft squeeze tube makes application much easier and cleaner. FYI: Carmex was the go-to balm for relief from the occasional cold sore before the advent of a topical antiviral."
This is the only lip gel I can use. All the others make my lips feel dry. And the tube makes it so easy to apply. No flavor so it doesn’t interfere with anything I eat.
I love Carmax because I don’t like chap lips. I do recommend you buy this.
"Easy to use, good size and fast delivery."
Medicated and great. It is glossier than others.
"I looove Carmex. For me it's a more affordable, hydrating gloss. And it kind of plumps my lips. Another plus is the shape of the tube. I find with regular chapstick shaped tubes, I lose them. I think it's because if they fall out of a pocket, they roll away, right into the depths of the under-bed, or the corners of my pillow case. This doesn't roll - I never lose it. The only real issue I have with this is that it has menthol in it, whereas when I buy it back home in the UK there is no menthol, which I prefer. My husband says the menthol smells really strong, so I have to wipe it off before smooches, lol."

Good but not the best
"Updating my review after re-reading the details and other's reviews.This is meant to be a 3 pack but I was only sent 1, so only 1 star.I thought I was getting a good deal for 3 lip balms and in fact was paying over double what I could have spent for the single tube."
Regret buying

"Much better than Chapstick, which actually end up drying out your lips in the long run. Did you know that your lipstick get addicted to Chapstick? These are a much better option. This will be my second purchase of these in a duo and I just finished the other two. I keep one on my Nightstand and use every night before I go to bed and the other one I keep in my handbag and I always use it underneath my lipsticks. Since It’s a balm it adheres to the lips and leaves a soft matte finish, but also is very hydrating. It’s great for those super matte lipsticks that dry your lips out. I always use these under lipid lipsticks and I think they look so much better with this underneath and it does not disrupt the color or the fact that the liquid lipstick does not come off on your cup. It just protects your lips underneath. Also, there’s no unwanted chemicals as these are clean beauty. There is no color in any of these."
"I picked up one of these lip balms on a whim while shopping in a local department store. They were on a table at the check out. One of my better impulse purchases.  I am hooked.  It applies smoothly and my lips are soft. It relieves my chapped lips without that waxy coating.  I like the mint flavor.  It's not overwhelming. I would consider this to be one of the best lip balms on the market - it competes with one of my other favorite ""natural"" lip balm brands. I recommend."
For years...literally years I used another lip balm and would never use another. Well inflation of products caused me to finally break the lip balm streak and it was time to look for another. I heard so many good things about eos lip balm but I ignored them until I didn't.I am a huge fan now. It glides on smooth and actually moisturizes your lips as opposed to just sitting on top of your lips. It being 100% natural was definitely a bonus. Like the cherry on top so to speak. I liked this set so much that I enrolled for their subscription.  Please see the poem below. Lol!I have a story to share with youAbout a lip balm that's amazing and trueIt's called eos and it's all naturalIt makes my lips feel so wonderfulI used to buy another brand for so longBut they got pricey and I felt it was wrongSo I gave eos a chance and I was surprisedIt glides on so smoothly and moisturizesNow I'm hooked and I can't get enoughI even subscribed to get more of this stuffSo if you're looking for a lip balm that's greatTry eos and you'll appreciate
It feels soft and smells nice. I will be purchasing more especially because it doesn't have petroleum in it.
IT LAST LONGER THAN OTHER BRANDS
Love these! Sweet mint is hard to come by at local stores. Glad I can still get it on Amazon.
"This product is just as described. It is worth the money, and works very well. It makes your lips very soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend buying this."
Very happy with this. I'm very picky about lipbalm. To me this is the best product!!
"moisturizes and smells nice, will recommend"
Lo bueno es que es natural
"Este bálsamo humecta mis labios por mucho rato, tiene un sabor y olor delicioso 😋 Dura muchísimo!"
"Seco, sem sabor e não parece original!"
"Humecta super bien, no deja los labios aceitosos"
"I've been using ChapStick Moisturizer Original Lip Balm for years, and it's my go-to for keeping my lips hydrated and protected. This pack of three is a great value, and I always keep one in my bag, car, and at home. The formula is lightweight but effective, and it doesn’t feel greasy or heavy on my lips, which I really appreciate. The added SPF 15 is a huge bonus, especially since I spend a lot of time outdoors and want to protect my lips from sun damage.What I love most about this ChapStick is how long-lasting the moisture is. I don't find myself needing to reapply constantly, even in dry or windy weather. My lips stay soft and smooth for hours after just one application. The scent and flavor are very subtle, which I like because it's not overpowering or distracting. It’s just the right amount of care without being too much.Overall, I highly recommend ChapStick Moisturizer Original Lip Balm to anyone looking for an affordable, reliable lip balm that also offers sun protection. The three-pack is convenient, and the quality is consistent with every tube. Whether you have dry, chapped lips or just want to keep them healthy year-round, this product does the job perfectly!"
this is one of the best chapsticks for keeping your lips moist and soft. great when your out in the weather and feels great
"It's Chapstick, you know what it is. No last minute impulse buy when getting groceries.It's less then store pricing and your dry lips will thank you for making them moist again."
We have tried other brands. Some make your lips feel greasy or sticky but never chapstick. It's our favorite brand and this is our favorite flavor.
It's the normal ;product we all use and convenient in the 3 pack
Great lip moisturizer.
Good stuff
"I love this chapstick💕!  I use it every day, no matter what!!!  My lips love it!!!🥰"
"Mega hidratante e o melhor, sem brilho. O único que já usei sem precisar retocar toda hora. Ainda assim prefiro o original sem FPS, mas esse cumpre bem o papel de proteger e hidratar."
Secondo me uno dei migliori lipstick
"This was a repeat purchase, as my wife liked it before also and she is using it for quite some time now. She is allergic to most of the products, and therefore she doesn't prefer other products she tried before. This one is good. I would recommend to go for it!"
Ótimo produto
"Thank you colour papers and Amazon for bringing this to us. This is indeed a great product. I've been using chapstick for over a year and this winter i got a blister pack of three. I didn't hesitate cause I know that there isn't a better product available in the Indian market. It's a genuine American brand and American made product. Good moisture and not glossy, so men can go for it without hesitation. Also they've improved the SPF of the chapstick from 12 to 15. Final verdict, great product, good Price and a satisfied customer."
"**Pros:**- **Coconut Kisses**: Every time I apply this balm, I feel like I’ve been whisked away to a tropical island. My lips are so soft, even my coffee cup gives me a cheeky wink.- **All-Day Moisturization**: My lips have been through desert-level dryness and this balm had them looking like they just took a dip in the Pacific. I’m talking hydration so intense, it’s like my lips have their own personal pool boy.- **Perfect Duo**: One for the purse, one for the desk—because you never know when you’ll need to rescue your lips from the Sahara desert they somehow wandered into during that Zoom meeting.- **Subtle Shine**: My lips have that “I woke up like this” glow, but without the extra stickiness. I’m shining like a lighthouse but in the “come hither” way, not the “watch out for rocks” way.**Cons:**- **Too Tempting**: The coconut scent is so delicious, I’ve caught myself trying to eat my own lips more than once. My dog now thinks I’m hiding snacks on my face.- **Lip Balm Addiction**: I used to be a casual balm user, but now I’m reapplying so often, I’m considering forming a support group. ""Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I’m addicted to lip balm.""- **Smooth Talker Syndrome**: My lips are now so smooth, I’m constantly slipping up on my words. I’ve gone from “eloquent speaker” to “stammering mess” because my lips are just too darn silky.**Verdict:** If you’re ready to turn your lips into tropical, ultra-moisturized clouds of happiness, this is your jam. Just be prepared for the coconut cravings, the urge to reapply every 5 minutes, and the possibility of smooth-talker slip-ups. Perfect for anyone who wants to bring a little vacation to their everyday life—one lip smack at a time!"
This has to be the best lip balm out there! We love this stuff. It lasts for hours with one application. Our lips have not been chapped once since using it. It is not too heavy and has a pleasant coconut smell. Better stock up before I do!
"My lips constantly fely tght and chapped.  I tried many brands but always come back to Palmers.  It has a nice formula that leaves lips soothed and feeling moisened.  it's not greasy but does have some slip to it.  I use it under and over lipstick, I'm happy to have found this product."
"This lip balm smells good, feels good but doesn't seem to last like regular chap stick. It could just be me because I've always liked the Palmers brand."
I love this lip balm. Leaves my lips without cracks and there is no taste left when using.
it make my lips too purple probably I applied too much
This chapstick is so soft on my lips and it smells like coconut. Mmmm! If you like coconut and oily/soft lips this is for you.
"..After 30 passes over my lips, prevents dryness at home and work. included in my first aid kits. bought multiple.."
"Ayuda a suavisar y quitar la resequedad, además huele muy bien"
"Chegou esse de tampa branca (os dois estou usando), mas gostaria daquele com a tampa marrom, maravilhoso!!! Infelizmente não é o mesmo resultado. Deixa a boca branca e sensação gosmenta. Quase que certeza, comprei com a imagem da tampa marrom à venda!! Faz uns dias já…"
They are not spf 15
The balm leaves a white cast and the scent has an unpleasant overbearing medicinal smell. Not bad but not very moisturising either. Wouldn't recommend.
Bon produit. Prix justifié.
"I have always loved EOS but love it even more with these flavors and stick versions. Seriously, I am ordering two more today so I can have them everywhere I am. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! They make my lips super soft and take away the chapped look. I have terrible dry skin, and I will try the lotion next!"
"These lip balms smell so good and glide on amazingly well. It doesn't stay on long though, so I am constantly reapplying. Do not feel heavy on lips either. Would recommend."
Very hydrating on the lips
As expected
I didn’t find these to be as smooth as other eos chapsticks. I also feel they have more of a “baseline” taste when you lick your lips. I wasn’t as big of a fan as the melon scent as much as I was hoping
Love this chapstick - glides on so smoothly and really moisturizes my lips!
"Love, love, love, love Eos!"
The pink lemonade smells amazing but the guava berry punch has a weird smell to me. Didn't like the the guava.
Besser als alle anderen. Ich benutze nur noch die.
Smells amazing and keeps my lips very moisturised for hours
Geruch und Geschmack auf den Lippen ist sehr intensiv und gleichzeitig sehr angenehm. Die Balsam haftet lange auf den Lippen und befeuchtet bemerkbar  die Trockenheit.
The product arrived open. The package was no sealed
Die zwei Lippenstifte sind geschmolzen angekommen und bis fast Hälfte abgelaufen!
"I saw this lip balm on a BuzzFeed list of TikTok famous products on sale during Prime Day sales. (I’m such a sucker for BuzzFeed lists.) I ordered the lip balm and the sleep mask, and I’m a fan now. The hype is real.98% of all lip glosses out there leave my lips more chapped and miserable after I use them. I can’t even do chapstick. But this does not chap or dry out my lips, not even in the arid high altitude environment of the Colorado mountains. Plus, it looks good and smells so yum. I got the berry and the gummy bear flavors and love both of them — with perhaps a little bit more favor for the gummy bear (just because of its yummy smell — they look the same on).  I highly recommend the sleeping mask as well."
"This is my absolute favorite lip balm! I purchased this balm years ago when it first launched. I have repurchased it ever since, and it was the product that introduced me to the brand.The balm is phenomenal. Its claims are spot on - it moisturizes and volumizes, and the balm's texture fills in the lip lines, giving your lips a more youthful appearance. It's a lip treatment as well because the feel and look of my lips have improved since I started using it.It works wonders for NYC summers and winters - something truly impressive since I usually prefer different textures depending on the season. Laneige is light enough for the heat, and protective and moisturizing enough for the cold.Although I enjoy using all the flavors, my most repurchased is the Berry one. The tint is subtle, but it does a great job at effortlessly perfecting and enhancing the look of your natural lip. I use it on bare lips usually, but they all also pair well on top of liner and lipstick.I always thought that the original lip mask and the Berry balm were the same thing in different packaging, but they are not. The lip mask feels a little bit heavier with more emollience than the lip balm. Although the color looks similar, the balm has a more noticeable tint to it, while the mask looks clear once applied.It's on the thicker side (when compared to other similar products), with a gel-like texture, however, it's not gloopy or sticky. It doesn't get stuck in my hair, and it also stays put - no bleeding outside the lip lines. Each balm smells like its designated flavor.  It has a pleasant barely-there scent that isn't overpowering. We all know that we end up ingesting a bit of whatever we put on our lips. The balm doesn't taste like anything. It's not sweet, but also not disgusting. It's something like a mild Aquaphor or Vaseline. Not something you'd really notice.Laneige's balms & masks will continue to hold that holy-grail status with me for years to come. Highly recommend!"
"After having a neogen treatment to entire face could not use my usual lip favorite of years, LAWLESS Women's Forget the Filler Cherry Vanilla Lip Mask, due to the hyaluronic acid, so I found this safe, clean product and am in LUST with. It goes on smooth and silky, has a cherry tone that is super cute, great scent, and lasts all night, leaving my lips the softest ever. It is NOT a lip plumper, but rather a top of the line lip moisturizer, great for fall. Stocking up-and gifting, a must have. I rarely give 5 stars but this a five star product, and am so happy with purchase."
"i bought this during amazon prime day as it was only $13 & such a steal!! this was my first time ever trying their balm & WOW its soo good and feels very moisturizing while giving such a nice gloss that’s not too overpowering as well as a very slight tint! i seriously wish i would’ve grabbed a few more while they were on sale but i’ll definitely be repurchasing when im out, i got the color/scent berry!"
This lip balm is pretty much a lip gloss in a tube that hydrates somewhat. It's really more of a lightly tinted high gloss in a convenient squeeze tube. Pretty disappointing compared to the lip mask in the jar. I purchased this for the convenience so it will be good for on the go in my purse. Probably won't purchase again. It is mildly scented as candy but not really any taste.
"I absolutely love this lip balm! This is my 3rd time buying it and I have gotten many of my friends and family to use it as well. It keeps my lips super hydrated, soft, and glossy which I love. I also appreciate that it is not sticky and lasts a while on my lips. In my opinion, it is worth the money and definitely a staple for me. I keep one in my purse, car, and bedroom at all times!"
"I can't believe I have never heard of or tried this brand of lip gloss/balm before!!! I live in Florida and everyone in my bottom lip splits. I have tried everything under the sun and nothing works!! I always have to keep reapplying and it never seems to soak in my lips. However this amazing brand soaks into my lips and I don't have to reapply it often it has been a game changer and a lifesaver!!! It actually soaks in and moisturizes, my lip stops resplitting. I will NEVER purchase any more chapstick, lip treatments or anything. Thank you thank you Laneige!!! ps I have only tried the lip glossy berry so far."
Recently I have been influenced to buy lip products by this brand because they were on sale for prime day & popular on social media. I truly believe these are worth the hype! I bought the sleeping mask first but the lip gloss is also amazing! I feel like it really does heal my dry cracked lips. Also the gorgeous packaging doesn’t hurt. Favor is stronger on the lip balm than the mask in my opinion but I really like it!
"This is an absolutely incredible lip balm. I wish I had a thousand more of it. It is super hydrating and lasts a long time, leaving your lips moisturized for hours."
"El producto llegó en buen estado y nuevo.Ya había probado otros productos de la marca Laneige, pero nunca este labial y puedo decir que es muy bueno. Mantiene hidratados los labios durante el día y huele delicioso. Tengo la mascarilla de noche y es un súper kit para mis labios."
Best lip balm ever
So far it’s really good for my lips!Perfectly hydrates!
"Hätte 5 Sterne bekommen, wenn der Preis nicht so happig wäre. Der Lip Balm ist sehr pflegend, klebt nicht und glänzt schön auf den Lippen."
"I suffer from chronic dry lips in the winter. So I figured let me get the most expensive lip balm to how better it will be. I purchased the men’s lip balm from Chanel and I did not notice a huge difference from the cheap stuff. I found this Mario B. lip balm on sale and decided to try it. It’s game changer. This works so well and the scent is not noticeable. I also hate it when the taste is bad because let’s face it, when you wear this stuff all the time it’s bound to get on your tongue and you taste it. For me, this works the best and it’s so inexpensive."
"I don’t like how normal chapstick feels a bit waxy and can be cakey— usually why I don’t wear any. This product feels very much like a lip gloss and it’s really glossy and hydrating. I never like ~naked~ lips but i have been using this for a few days now without any colored lip gloss or lipstick and I’m already seeing a noticeable difference! My lips are super soft, they look healthy and the glossy shine is very cute. Definitely believe the hype on this and buy it, you won’t regret it."
"I've been looking for a new chapstick for quite some time because I had extremely dry lips after my son was born and my regular Carmex just wouldn't cut it. I found this one and saw that it was highly rated so decided to give it a whirl. I was pleasantly surprised the first time I applied it. Typically these types of squeeze tubes with balm leave my lips feelings sticky and tacky but this one feels so smooth with zero stick. It also helped heal my lips completely so now I just use it as my every day chapstick because I love it so much. I purchased the original scent and it's virtually scentless which was perfect for my first time trying this brand. I'll definitely be purchasing more and trying out the other scents now that I know this is quality balm! Highly recommend for anyone who wants a new staple, every day wear chapstick."
I like this balm! The rose scent is mild and it doesn't have a taste.I also noticed that it doesn't migrate into my mouth as bad as other balms. I have other unflavored balms that I can eventually feel in my mouth and this one doesn't do thatI've been having some badly chapped lips recently and idk if I'm dehydrated or if it has something to do with my skincare. My lips are pretty sensitive right now and I love that this balm doesn't have any mint or menthol in it.
"Update: I reordered this in non-scented and like it much better unscented. I just came to really like this formula! It lasts a long time and leave my lips so hydrated. I even became used to the rose scent but I'll stick with the unscented.-----------First, I sure wish I'd have paid attention to the 'Rose"" scent part of this - it isn't in the title so I completely missed it on the pic of the tube. Ugh. Rose. I just do not like the scent of roses. But, fortunately it does dissipate after a little bit of time.This formula is thick. With the coconut oil and shea I thought it would be a little more emollient and a tad more 'slippery' -- not that I want something super oily or super slippery.However, one good thing about this is its staying power. Once I get over the rose scent, and the thickness of it, it tends to absorb some and then leave a thinner layer over my lips that feels nice and moisturizing. A lot of lip balms don't last and my lips feel drier than ever, but this one does last and does keep my lips feeling moistened. For example, I put this on before bed and usually throughout the night my lips will feel dry but I can go most of the night without applying anything to my lips - sometimes all night.I wouldn't order the rose again but I would consider trying another scent."
"I have spent the last couple years spending way too much money looking for a moisturizing lip balm. Thought I'd found one, but then turns out it was drying my lips even more. I didn't want a product that would just sit on my lips, offering shine but nothing else. My lips tend to feel dryer once it wears off.THIS stuff does the trick. During the day or at bed time. My lips have felt much better and I don't feel that embarrassing need to lick my lips due to dryness in between applications (I often leave it at my desk at work when I'm up and about).I bought 2 more."
"My lips were soooooo dry and cracked. I mean skin was peeling and just kind of flaking off all the time. I usually use Vaseline or shea butter its a temporary fix, But doesn't last long. I've been using the mint lip balm it literally last all day! I've been reapplying right before bed after I brush my teeth and in the morning it's still on my lips. My lips are already back to how they should be and I've been using this for maybe 5 days!! Buy it I love it and it adds a delicate healthy looking shine  not too glossy."
"Actually moisturizes your lips so you don't have to keep constantly applying it, as with some other balms I've used. Also better for hot weather as it's not a stick that will melt. Will continue to buy this."
I ordered this lip balm from Amazon and I really liked it.  I have since found it at Shoppers Drug Mart for a much lower price ($10.00).  I will be buying it there in the future.
"I don't usually write reviews but I had to for this one. I am writing this review after using the lip balm for over a week. This has helped me greatly in healing my chapped lips and some allergy I had. My lips are nice and soft now and I could not thank this lip balm enough! It's expensive, sure, but if you are someone who has chapped lips then this lip balm is for you. I love it and will buy it again FOR SURE!!"
Nothing healed my cracked lips until I used this product. Expensive but worth it
"Soy de labios terriblemente resecos pero odio los bálsamos que se sienten pesados o grasosos, así que he probado de todo (Blistex, Carex, Labello, Eos, Laneige, IT Cosmetics).Me encantó este lip balm, que no se siente pesado, hidrata muy bien y deja una sensación de alivio por mucho tiempo.Por las noches aplico una capa más gruesa y me funciona igual que la mascarilla de Laneige, por mucho menos dinero.Al no tener color y tener un muy ligero olor a coco también puede funcionar para los hombres."
My girl put me on and let me say I’m never going off!!!! It’s amazing moisturizing and makes my lips glowwww! Doesn’t add any colour but enhances my lips natural colour. Got sooo many compliments when I wore it out today and I apply it before bed too as an overnight mask and it gets the job done! What more can I ask for!
"I have always loved Burt's Bees Pomogranate lip balm and definitely wanted to try the seasonal Pumpkin Spice, which was also fantastic. But, I also fell for the Chai and the Vanilla Maple as well. You really can't go wrong with this set, they are all great! Thanks Burt's Bees."
Love the flavors and Burt's Bees always makes top quality products.  Split the pack with my daughter.  Good price point.  These flavors are in high demand & hard to find.  Great moisturing & lovely flavors.  Definitely purchase again.
"I prefer the variety of seasonal flavors and long lasting use of the Bert’s Bees chap stick from Amazon rather than the lack of what is available in retail stores. Why are there so few choices? The only better selection is from Sam’s of six flavors and a total of 12 sticks. I end up leaving sticks in pockets, purses, car, and in the kitchen."
My only issue with these is they liquify if left in higher temperatures. I left one in the car on a warm day and opened it not thinking and it ruined my pants.
Like the flavors
"Burt's Bees products, always natural, always good!"
My daughter and I split these and love each scent
Nice smell for lips. Smooth on lips
Was missing the pomegranate one the rest were there tho
毎回購入するショップは異なっているかもしれませんが、ここ数年はこのメーカーのリップを使用しています。香りは好みの分かれるところですが、機能は組成と価格を考慮すると今のところ最善の品かと思っています。ちなみにベリー系は周りの評判がよろしいようです。
完全にリピーターです。とちかく好き、つけ心地も香りも良いです。少し甘い？ように思いますか、それも、また良しです。
Nice flavours and moisturising
安心して使えます。使い心地もよいし、香りも強くなくいい感じです。
"It's a great basic but longwearing lip balm. It has a very, very subtle citrus flavor. The texture is smooth, balmy and waxy, in a good way. I like the waxy coating because it stays put for longer than the more oily balm. It's great for night time, but anytime also. Just a great, longlasting basic lip balm that works!"
I love this product for my chapped lips. Works great and always order more.
Easy to apply and feels good on
I love the quality. I’ll keep stocking up.
No smell.  Easy to apply.  Great for chapped lips
Great
I have always used Nevea
"Nivea sells/used to sell both a lip balm with a light blue cap, as well as this dark blue capped one. I actually prefer the light blue version but have not seen it anywhere for some time. This dark blue version is very good though."
"I love this balm for lips, it keeps on helping my sore lips in a dry climate."
"si me gustaron y a buen precio, incluso viene sellado cada frasco"
"Llegó uno menos de lo que debía llegar y la caja estaba abiertaBien puede ser que eso sucedió en la paquetería, pero no debería de pasar"
"I love this lip balm so much! I bought it for a friend and accidentally bought two so I kept one for myself and I love it so much! Great as a birthday present or anything else! I can not explain how good this lip balm smells! It is very moisturizing and the packaging is super cute and great for on the go. The pink color is so nice! This can practically fit in any bag and great if you want a natural lip that smells very good. As it says this is a lip balm so it does not have color or glitter but it leaves a very nice natural shine.  Also this lip balm comes with a very good amount of product. I will say that it is a little pricy for a lip balm but if you are willing to spend the extra penny it is an amazing product and I definitely will buy again for future gifts. My friend absolutely loves it and says she wears it every day to freshen up and make her smell nice. Honestly this scent is so good if there was a perfume made with this scent I would definitely buy it!!! Also this is something I find very fun, when you close the lip balm it has a very nice click!"
"LOVE SHEA BUTTER In ALL Forms. Excellent Hydration For ALL Your Body Parts. The Lip Balm Actually Tastes Like You Just Had A Serving Of ""Birthday Cake With Butter-Cream Frosting""!First Purchase Of EROS, But MY Lips Remain Coated & Moist After 3 Hours. I Recommend, WE Check-Out, MORE Flavors!Sherrie A."
This is an awesome brand of chapstick. It feels great on your lips. It really smells like cake and is great for Birthday gifts. It's easy to apply and lasts a long time.
EOS is one of the best lip balms I've ever had and the birthday cake is my favorite.
"I love everything about it but the smell. I'm just not big on artificial birthday cake scents or fake vanilla, but otherwise, it's a great lip balm."
Quick delivery. Very festive. The cutest addition for birthday gifts…added this to a preteen girl’s bday gift.
"What a cute add on for a birthday gift bag! Cute package, great price."
Love this product for teacher gifts - who doesn't love natural lip balm?
"The skin on my lips is a bit delicate and dries out very easily. Add to that I live in an arid climate which only exacerbates the problem. When I feel any tough or dead skin on my lips I have the nervous habit of using my teeth to nip at it, which only makes it thicker and more callous. I then use paraben-based lip products to try to heal and soften the skin- but it only covers the thick skin. Then when the paraben wears off the skin is a bit softer and more willing to come off, and again I nip at the edges trying to remove the dead skin. This becomes a vicious cycle and has been something of a problem. People would catch me nipping at my lips and wonder what the heck I was doing! So I. Tried HARD to resist the urge to nip in front of people or to hide it. Then that inevitable moment when you go too far and break the skin or a crack starts. UGH!!I even tried various exfoliants to remove this skin, but the nervous habit remained. I went so far as to use my coffee grinds with honey to exfoliate, then immediately moisturize and try to seal the skin. I even resorted to experimenting with different hand lotions AND THEN lip balm after exfoliating. This has helped, but it's also rough on my lips and is a lot of work to do. I have to do this 2-3 times a day to just maintain having not-quite cracked lips! I needed this to stop! So I tried to just outright break the habit of nipping at it and just keep them treated and late them just HEAL. I was doing pretty well for like five days, but any time I would get nervous or feel dead skin... it's like a nervous tick. I do it without thinking and catch myself. But the damage was done. Then again with exfoliating and moisturizing. The vicious cycle continued.So I set out to really do some research, and this product consistently came up as a solution. Well, I've only been using it for two days now, and my lips are 75% better. Any time I feel the need to nip I just apply this. I've only exfoliated twice in two days now. Every time I go to nip I find there's virtually nothing to nip at! My lips are not fully healed yet, but I think that they will be within a few more days. They're finally soft again. The tough skin is nearly all gone! This stuff seems to both penetrate and protect the surface. It's quickly getting to a point that I no longer have to think about my lips. If I feel the urge to nip I just apply this and pretty much forget about it and move on with my day.Hopefully this helps someone else. It's weird to be sort of excited something so trivial, but sometimes it's the small victories!I just hope they never change and ruin the working formula like so many companies do!"
I’ve been purchasing these for a while off Amazon they have a much greater price and I tend to leave them in the car in my purses and just great to have a few more on hand especially with Colder weather coming they help keep my lips nice and healthy
".I’ve always been a Chapstick loyalist, but after using a different Aquaphor product, my experience was so positive that I wanted to try this lip balm.  I’m a musician who can’t afford to get chapped lips, and I have really sensitive and reactive skin, so any old lip balm won’t do. I avoid fragrances and don’t need color, too. I’ve been really pleased with this lip balm.  I put it on before going to bed, and my lips stay moistened a very long time. I wasn’t sure I’d like how the balm is squeezed out, but it works better than expected, with just a few experiences of getting too much.  This balm works really well improving very dry, irritated lips, and just like other Aquaphor products I’ve tried, it’s very non-reactive and causes no skin irritation.  I’ve even used it as a quick moisturizer on the area below the eyes, and on other dry skin spots. Worked great!I recommend for anyone, but especially for musicians, for sensitive skin areas, outdoors people, and allergy prone folks.  Scent and color-free, it has a light sheen after application that can be worked in to matte finish if you want.  The sheen does look nice.  Highly recommend."
This stuff will fix your lips ASAP. It is not thick so you need to add a thicker more wax based chapstick(I like Soothing Touch brand or Burt’s Bees as a backup). But it will make any cracks or edges feel better sooner than any other lip product I have ever tried. I highly recommend despite the high price for such little product that dries quickly.
I work in cosmetics but am allergic to the lip products Ive started using.  They make my lips feel really rough textured. Someone said to try this and I'm glad i did.  Worked in a few hours.
Got it for my 8 year old who had chapped lips. Other brands weren't working. Tried this and immediate relief to her cracked and chapped lips.
"I have severe chapped lips and when checking top products, Aquaphor rated highest and I have used other of their products.  Always find them as advertised and they are price prohibitive.  Their reputation is very strong."
"Living in Colorado, our lips get soooo dry. This is the only thing I’ve found that keeps them moisturized in winter."
"Just arrived back from a week in the sun, Cancun,Mexico. I wore sunscreen and a hat all the time, but the lower portion of my face, including my lips got way too much sun! My lips were blistered on the bottom. Could be the effect of too many salted margaritas on the beach. In any case, they hurt and were cracked and dry. My lips needed a lot of help quickly. I found this item and realized I had used it once before. It arrived the next day and I started to use immediately especially overnight. In about 3 days everything looked and felt great! I can highly recommend this product to any fair skinned people like me out there. It is a soft cram that absorbs quickly into the skin on and around your lips. It fixed my problem likity split!"
Used by a person with very dry and cracked lips this has provided real comfort and aided healing. It’s more than a lip salve or balm and it’s highly recommended.
Perfect
"The holy grail for lips. Much less greasy than vaseline, but really nice occlusive effect. I like using it as a night mask after my lip balm to seal in the effect. Does not leave any residue on the lips, and my lips are now soft and smooth."
"Buy it you want  to regret  it, I’ve been using for a year and it hasn’t run out"
"Living in Grand Junction Colorado the weather can get hot and my skin becomes dry, I have used this product for years and found it to be the best product for me, it is light on the skin and smells amazing along with a nice tingle from the mint."
"I never used a ball shaped lip balm before.  I was looking for something all natural but fun. When you're on a restricted diet lovely smelling lip balm is a worthwhile treat. This isn't waxy like the drugstore tubes, or glossy, no color. Just addictively good smell and smooth creamy moisturizing."
"Love the design, never have to “look for it” as it’s round and easily spotted. Works great on lips. Never going back to tube chapsticks."
"The strawberry sorbet lip balm smells so good, complements your lips well and keep them hydrated and moisturized, definitely recommend."
"This is a great lip balm! It lasts me all day with just one application! Plus, it goes on really nice and smooth without leaving pieces on my lips.The only thing I don't like is the shape of the container. It's round, so very bulky, making it hard to fit in small spaces or pockets. But that's a small price to pay for such an excellent lip balm."
Im happy with my purchase!
"It’s been close to impossible to get EOS lip balm, my favourite, till I finally found it at Amazon! I hope the start selling it again here in Norway soon."
Super soft love it
Great price and the scent is so nice!
"Amo esta marca, lo compre en oferta, excelente, labios hidratados, aroma agradable, duradero.No hay falla , eos, eucerin, palmers y vaseline mis favoritas!! en mi top para el cuidado de labios."
"The media could not be loaded.
                



Huele muyy ricoo siempre tengo resequedad en los labios y este bálsamo me ayudo demasiado y por más tiempo"
"Embora muito caro, não se compara. É o melhor que existe."
Amei desde o cheiro e a hidratação.
"I use this lip therapy balm at bedtime to moisturize my dry lips. We have harsh, dry winters and hot summers and it takes a toll on the lips. This lip balm is a life saver! I apply it at night and my lips feel soft and smooth in the morning. Never want to be without it. I also appreciate that it has no fragrance or flavorants added which can be irritating. If you are looking for a straight up moisturizing lip product, I highly recommend this."
Excellent product.  Use it constantly every day.  Creamy texture and feels good on my lips.  Would highly recommend.  Been using for a few years.
exactly as advertised. this is always the lip balm i use and i love it sm! i wish they did have more eco-friendly packaging but i love it nonetheless!
I believe it’s got a drying effect. But still does the job temporarily! Also fits on lip balm holders.
"Does not feel sticky and keeps my lips moisturized. Also, zero flavor which I was looking for."
"Works as described, love the tube, great product. Quick delievery."
Smooth smell good
"My lips get dryer than the Sahara at all times and so I had been putting Vaseline on my lips after moistening them with water to tame them. I wanted to try Vaseline with a moisturizer built in instead, but after trying this one I'm not particularly impressed.It's noticeably thinner and I feel like I have to rub on a lot of it or reapply it constantly to get the same effect as normal Vaseline and as such it's not as good at locking in the moisture. It probably works fine for people with normal, run-of-the-mill dry lips but not for mine. I got better results from putting skin moisturizing lotion on my lips then putting normal Vaseline on top."
"These are great lip balms! I was using lots of burts bees before, but I find these more moisturizing. It's nice to have a non-flavored version to apply before eating and I like the minty ones too. Haven't tried the citrus yet."
My lips love this chapstick. It’s smooth and not too overwhelming with the smells.
My regular lip balm is CS. I thought I try something different but I was disappointed. I just could not taste or smell as much flavor as the other brand name. I will use it but I will not purchase again.
These are very nice! I love the different options for fragrance and that they are organic.
"I tried these lip balms in my effort to find some brand I've never used before that will be BETTER than what I've previously used - different Blistex formulations; different ChapStick formulation; and Bert's Bee's lip balms. None of those really kept my lips smooth and hydrated and I also had to keep applying any of those throughout the day and especially before bedtime. But the Cliganic balms are wonderful! I have finally found a brand that uses ingredients that are different from the brands I mentioned, thus that must be the ""secret"" in the way my lips are now moisturized for a few more hours before I have to reapply. Also, I was wary of how strong the flavors might be - I don't like vanilla or coconut flavors as a rule in balms or skin lotions - but again, I was pleasantly surprised that none of the 6 options were over-powering. Really like these and if the nice effects and benefits continue to prove true ... I've found my go-to for lip balms."
"The scents are great, the tubes are full, its a worry-free buy."
"Overall, very good lip balm. Moisturizing, nice citrus scent on the one that I opened and used. However, one of the lip balms, inside the box was not sealed and had no top cover for it? I was disappointed, in that it was the Beeswax one. But i didn't feel like returning it."
"Once I found this lip balm, I’ll never buy anything else. Goes on smooth. I have one in the car, by my bed, on my bike and in my pocket. I’ll say that the one in my car has never completely melted, softened yes. You won’t regret giving this a try."
This is a very smooth gliding lip balm that keeps lips that immediately moistens lips for instant relief.
Ils sont bien fait et très agréable
"Humectantes, delis y olor suave. Sin color. Me restaura super bien los labios y/o los mantiene hidratados"
"Estos bálsamos me encantaron, huelen muy bien e hidratan perfecto, sin dejar la piel grasa. Son suaves y los sabores son acordes con lo que se espera. Los volveré a comprar.Actualización: los compré dos veces más, pero dejé de hacerlo porque el precio aumentó terriblemente, lo cual es una lástima. Ahora incluso cobran gastos de envío."
"Baumes très hydratants, parfums variés"
"Best price for the product unless you find it on sale at whole foods or something. I love the quality of this organic chapstick. Soo cool, smoothing, and refreshing. Been using the same one for 8 years."
A few years back my brother in law gave me this product and ever since then I order it at least every 6 months. I put it on every night before bed or when I'm not wearing lipstick. It's so soothing.
"If you are living in low humidity mountains of Mexico - these are a reliable every day product that really helps. Smooth feeling, reasonable price for quality. Puts Burt’s 🐝 & aquaphor in dust for me."
I no longer get that stiff plasticy feeling on my lips. They stay soft and moisten. It's long lasting.  I keep a tube of this balm everywhere I might want to use it. Including one in my pocket for when I'm not at home. I'm definitely a life long customer now!
It really protects and soften your lips and I love Peppermint so perfect for me
"I have tried several lip balms over the past couple of years (ever since Walgreens stopped making their lip balm) never finding one that came close to the Walgreens one.  This one is the best, will be buying it again."
"With any organic beauty product, there is inconsistency from batch to batch. The same is true with this product. This batch was the most luxurious of any I’ve used previously, and that’s a lot of years worth of use. This goes on soft and smooth, and stays on for hours. The only downside, and first time this has happened, is the scent. Smells like dog food. Took some getting used to, and seems to be subsiding (or I’ve become nose blind by sheer will) but it feels so delightful and comfortable to wear, that I’m willing to tough out the stink."
Does the job without added chemicals
I’ve been addicted to lip balm for 50 years.  I’ve always only liked the same “waxy” kind.  I tried this based on ratings and i won’t be going back to my usual.  This balm is light and soft.  Not waxy at all. Not greasy either but more softening without that heavy feeling
"It has that great balance of neither pulling on your lips nor clumping off due to being the wrong consistency, plus there isn't the chemical aftertaste that comes with some of the popular beeswax balms. Ordering from Amazon because its always out of stock in retail."
I was looking for something without any nasty ingredients and found this on the ewg website. It's great! I get very dry lips and it's really hydrating and smells amazing too.
"I mistakenly thought I was buying a bulk pack of 6, and would not have bought if I had known. But the product is good otherwise."
"I have given 5 stars for this lip balm because it rightly deserves so! This is my first review writing about a product and I am more than happy that this is the product I have chosen because after a long time I have found my holy grail lip product for chapped lips..this more than assists in any lip condition a girl might have..Sore lips, chapped..dry..I apply this in the morning 5 minutes before I do the rest of my make up..making them perfectly plump and soft by the time I apply my other products..then once again in the night time before going to bed, leaving them well moisturised and conditioned. This is a fantastic product and would definitely re-purchase and recommend to everyone! So go on girls, after you have read this don't waste any more time and purchase yours! :) Much love to all!"
"Let me begin by saying, I have literally tried EVERYTHING known to human kind for my extremely dry and cracked lips. As a person with systemic lupus and fibromyalgia, I’m used to battling a lot of health issues and chronic fatigue/pain. I drink a lot of water every day, yet I still deal with chronic dry skin and unfortunately, even worse, dry lips. It takes every ounce of willpower I have not to bite or pick at the peeling dry skin on my lips and peel it off which only results in my lips cracking open and bleeding. I have tried every single brand ranging from bargains to more expensive products available at every brick & mortar store, including lanolin products, and Burt’s Bee’s chapstick, which only seemed to make matters worse. O’Keeffe’s Lip Balm is the only thing I can use during the day that somewhat helps me. After reading all of the really great reviews for Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, I decided to give it a try. I also noticed other people were leaving reviews who like me, previously had zero success no matter what they had tried before, were combining the Laneige WITH Burts Bee’s Overnight Intensive Lip Treatment. Thanks to their experimentation & taking the time to write extensive reviews, I was also able to ensure that I ordered a silicone applicator and both products! I put each product on every night before bed, & I put both on every morning before I leave the for work, and I carry them in my purse just in case I’m extremely busy throughout my day & not hydrating as much as I should be, just to keep my lips from getting super chapped. I know many people have expressed hesitation about the price point of the Laneige product for the size of the container. However, I would argue that there ARE MAJOR, valuable benefits, including the quality and longevity of the product. It’s truly a long term investment for your skin care. You actually don’t use very much AT ALL! It takes such a MINUTE amount to achieve the desired results. I received mine a few months ago and I have hardly used any of it. Sincerely, if you’re like me, and so many others, & have been struggling for a long time trying to find something that will actually help your dry, cracked, & peeling lips, this is the product to accomplish your goal! I highly recommend also getting the Burt’s Bee’s Overnight Intensive Lip Treatment with Ceramides (in the purple box) & get a silicone applicator, and go ahead and order a duo of the O’Keeffe’s Lip Balm for use throughout the day. Here’s my daily routine: After brushing my teeth and washing my face, using my silicone applicator, I apply the Burts Bee’s Overnight Intensive Lip Treatment, then I apply the Vanilla Laneige Vanilla (careful to avoid applying too much at the corners of my mouth, I have sensitive skin that is prone to break outs) In the mornings, I repeat these same steps again, pack both items into my small make up bag and place it in my purse and voilàFor the FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, my lips are actually soft and healthy! THANK YOU LANEIGE! ❤️🫶"
My lips have always been dry. They cracked and peeled all the time. I’ve tried everything then I stumbled over this product. After one use I noticed a huge difference. I’ve been using it for 3 months and my lips are never dry and they never peel. I actually love it so much I use it during the day because it looks like an amazing lip gloss! Thank you so much for such a great product. It seems pricey but I’m not even halfway through the container after 3 months and I use it throughout the day and my kids even use it!
"The Laneige sets are the best! I look forward to the holiday seasons because I get to try out new flavors. Every single lip product that I have tried from them I love. This midnight mini set has berry, mango, gummy bear, watermelon, and peach iced tea. I buy these sets for myself (40s) and my daughter who is in her teens. They are great for any age. They are a perfect gift that anyone and everyone will love. They make your lips so soft and moisturized! Your lips will thank you!"
"I am a big fan of this company and this lip sleeping mask is one of my favorite items from them. The only one I like better is the glowy balm, and I tend to buy the scent that I like in both items. This gummy bear sent is my absolute favorite, it's sweet and sugary smelling and it reminds me of using my old lip smackers when I was a kid. It's also very moisturizing, when I put it on at night I wake up with very soft lips. I've definitely noticed less dry skin on my lips since I've started using this and the glowy balm during the day. I would absolutely recommend this to anybody who likes to pamper themselves and has chapped lips."
"Tween daughter had been dying to get one of these so when it popped up on a deal, I went ahead and ordered for her as a surprise. Of course she was over the moon and uses it like it’s gold. She had me try it when it came, too. A little goes a long way, so the small amount that comes in the jar will definitely last longer than you think. It was thick, smooth, and hydrating. We put it on before bed and I was shocked it was still on in the morning!  (I am NOT a peaceful sleeper lol.) My lips still felt soft, plump, and hydrated, and still even had a faint scent of vanilla.Bottom line is this is definitely a pricey brand, but it does work and will last a really long time when not over-applied."
"I’ve tried vaseline, aquaphor, and carmex, but none of them have measured up with this lip mask. It leaves my lips moisturized and soft all day (I use this in my morning routine even though it says it’s a sleeping mask). Price is a little hefty, but since you need such little product, it lasts a very long time. Highly recommend it and it’s definitely worth it!"
"I love this lip mask. I know it’s a little pricey but it’s totally worth it. Historically I have had really dry lips that would peel and look gross. Once I started using this every night, they are soooo much better. No more dry lips.Also I bought my first one 2 years ago and still had about 1/3 of it left. And I use it almost every night. I thought it was about time to change it out so I ended up buying another. So even though it’s pricey, it will last you a long time!"
I received a sample size in the Amazon 2023 Beauty advent calendar. I liked it so much that I purchased the full size product in the jar which comes with an applicator. It lasts a long time but not that convenient for using on the go in your purse. I recently purchased their lip balm in the tube but it's not the same. I absolutely recommend this lip mask. It keeps my lips moist without flaking.
"I've wanted to purchase this lip mask for around a decade but I've always been hesitant due to the price. I decided to pull the trigger during prime days and I'm delighted.It's a large container and I feel like it will last a long time since you don't need to use much.The consistency, smell and taste are lovely.It also stays on your lips for hours even after licking them.Now I want the other flavours!"
No more dry lips!
Muy buena protección labial nocturna
"Cumple perfectamente su función, suave y huele delicioso"
excelente
"Very happy customer. Glad I ordered this. I tried another product first, which claimed to be organic.Brand name similar. Threw most of it in the trash. Bad odor. Ordered this at a similar cost to replace it. Just wanted something with a hint of tint that I can apply without a mirror and not worry about looking like a clown when I am done. This fits that request. Natural looking even on me. I am very fair-skinned. I think a darker-skinned individual would prefer the black cherry flavor/color. I get some color or enough color with all of the flavors. I just wanted enough to disguise the bluish hue that sometimes shows up a little on me because I am so fair. (natural redhead). Nice for applying without looking which is what I wanted. Another brand that is named after one of my favorite flying insects has an intense color payload and I found that I would apply that in the grocery store only to get to the car and be shocked at my appearance. No wonder people stared at me. I looked like a fool!! I can apply this like chapstick and also look nice--a little nicer. Moisture and a little flavor, just enough that it doesn't taste icky. Not enough that my pets are after it. No fancy packaging that anyone is going to covet or steal my stuff. Nowadays I think it is better to go out of the house with less. It is just a plastic case, not some glitter that will attract evil eyes. Save the good and fancy for just the right time or just keep it at home. People are breaking into high-end cosmetic stores, crazy. I don't want to be harmed for my lip product. I don't think people will come for me over a tube of this."
"For years I've always loved Nivea products, which is why I love exploring their new products. I recently discovered this Nivea Lip Care fruit variety pack that has tinted lip balm 4 pack and I love how instantly my lips felt hydrated, smooth, and no more needing for a lipstick as these not only smell delicious like a fruit but it has a tinted color. My lips are ready for any occasion thanks to this set! My favorite one is the blackberry tinted lip care one but all 4 are really great and work perfectly on my natural full lips. The best part, unlike most lipsticks these don't stain my cups, lasts a while and doesn't dry up my lips! Super easy to apply on or remove when needed. Easy to retouch when needed but not needed as often as regular lipstick! Great quality and the best part is that my lips have never felt better! Perfect for date night, work day, girls day out, going to events and so much more!! I highly recommend this set!! It makes it a great gift for self, for someone special, teacher appreciation day, holiday gifts and birthday present addition!!"
"These are great.  Each lip balm actually smells like the fruit and they also each give a different tint that is distinctive.  The scents are relatively decent - not nauseating.I have light to medium skin tone (leaning more light), and the Strawberry balm is about my lip color and leaves a bright peachy pink tint.  There is a light gloss finish (typical balm finish) that makes you look healthy.  And it's moisturizing.  The texture and feel of the application to your lips feels pretty good imo.  Good price point.  All balms leave a visible tint on my lips.  Watermelon, which is the lightest one, barely (just barely) leaves a light pink tint."
"This is my first time using this product and this brand.The product is lightly tinted, would appear as if you have nothing on. So should you prefer a colour that is more pronounced you may have to use a lip liner or lipstick still.I am of light dark completion, and my lips have always have a slight pink tint to it. I am only able to see the colour when I use the cherry or the blackberry. Watermelon is barely noticeable along with the Strawberry.The moisture aspect is a little disappointing. It moisturises,  however it does not last as long as the other brand I'm using.  So basically I have to use the two together to get the effect and comfort I'm after."
These leave a nice tint on your lips and wear pretty well. Its dry and hot where I live so I have to reapply every hour.The colors are pretty but sheer.  I always gravitate towards Blackberry because it actually shows a color.  The others are pretty sheer but they leave a slight tint. They don't taste of anything but they do have a pretty scent.
"With just a hint of color i really like this product for keeping my lips moisturized and looking good.I out one in my work bag,  one in my purse and of course one in my overnight bag.  I wont leave home without this lip moisturizer. Nivea is one of my favorite brands.  They have quality products at a great price."
"I love the scents, reminds me of the bonne bell days. The color payoff is nice, not too overwhelming but still a nice flush of color. And it's buttery smooth and will definitely help keep up your lip care routine. Good gift for tweens too!"
"The design is bad but product is good. As you apply the balm, it twirls down the tube. Need to hold the tube and bottom during application.  Very annoying"
"Los labiales llegaron bien, estaba abierta la caja de Nivea pero los labiales si contaban con su sello y estaban nuevos, me encantan los colores y su olor."
Great
pleased
"It's so soft it gets everywhere, I feel like my lips get dryer quicker so I have to keep reapplying, just stick to Burt's bees lip balm, it does everything you need"
"Calidad 10/10, llegaron rápido y bien empaquetados, los ame demasiado."
I use chapstick everyday/night and I appreciate it's helping to soften my lips as they get very dry & can crack open.  It's a simple but effective way to keep lips from drying out.9l
Decided to load up on my addiction. These are simple yet affordable so my family doesn’t say much. No intervention planned as of yet but if I start buying Burt’s bees you better believe one is coming!
Chapstick classic is my go to. Flavored lip balms contain some sort of chemical which bothers my lips. This is the one and only!
"Chapstick is still the best, the cap is easily removed other brands are not! great strength is required!"
Hubby favorite chap stick
Package was in good condition and all tubes were sealed properly.
Only chapstick I use. It’s great!
"I buy in bulk, you can never have enough."
Muito bom produto
"The color is vibrant, and it applies smoothly without streaks. Dries quickly and lasts longer than expected. The brush design makes application precise. Definitely, a must-have for anyone into nail art or just looking for a reliable, long-lasting polish."
Loved
These chapsticks are amazing. They make your lips very soft. It's my favourite lipbalm
"Wildly overpriced compared to others, but this is a good quality lip balm with a delicate rose scent and light texture. It’s not heavy or shiny, which is exactly what I want in a daily use lip balm. One application does last a good long while on the lips, so that’s how I justify the price to myself.Sometimes the formulation isn’t stable so the beeswax isn’t always fully integrated, but if that happens I just pop it in my pocket for a few hours and it smooths out again. The price is insane, but this stuff moisturizes so well that I just keep buying it 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"At first, I was a bit disappointed in the chapstick. But I was wrong! I live in a cold, mountain climate and my lips are usually peeling this time of year. I only use it at night as a lip treatment and I’m fully hydrated. This lip balm lives up to the L’Occitane brand."
Very good product
"I was looking for unscented lip balm with no flavor or color. This seemed like it could work. Until it arrived.I tried it despite having a definite aroma. It glided on nice but the smell transitioned into a taste that completely turned me off. Honestly, it could have absorbed something it was stored next to. Idk. But it was totally unpleasant for me.To the company’s credit they did give me a refund despite not being a returnable item. It was their choice to do so and I am very thankful to them, as the balm was not cheap. For this reason I bumped the stars up to four."
"I am a lip balm fiend. This is hands down the best ive ever found. Im terrible at drinking water; so my lips are always chapped. This is a life saver. Has a very pleasant very mild scent to it; almost not there. Sits very nice on the lips, not too heavy, but moisturizing enough to work wonders. I highly recommend you give it a try for sure. Never buying another lip balm, only this one."
"What a waste of money for a single tube of chapstick. I have terribly dry skin and my lips are in need of a deep moisturizer, which has made me somewhat of a chapstick snob. The best was Out of Africa Shea Butter but they went out of business, which is why, when this chapstick advertised itself as “shea butter”, I wanted to try it. The texture is akin to any run of the mill chapstick, in particular Eos, and the fragrance is terrible. I think Burt’s Bees Raw shea butter chapstick is much better quality and the same price. Too bad its difficult to find. Save yourself some money and buy the basic Burt’s Bees in Vanilla Bean. At least you’ll get a two for one deal and save a few dollars. This is nothing special."
Enjoying using this product. Coats the lips well and lubricates them well.
I like the product ok. It’s a little thicker than i thought it would be. Feels more like chapstick that a silky feel i was expecting. It also came just as is…no box and no plastic seal????? What's up with that? 🤔
"I love this lipbalm, worth every penny if you suffer from dry lips 💋"
Buena compra.
Einer der besten Lippenpflegestifte.
"Pour en avoir essayé plusieurs, je reviens toujours à celui-ci."
"Huele demasiado bien , es suave y tiene ingredientes naturales en comparación con los balsamos de farmacia tiene una consistencia ligera  le daría las 5 estrellas pero es una realidad que en la página de l'occitane esta mucho más barato yo decidí adquirirlo aquí por qué si solo pides una pieza por menor de los 1200 en la página de l'occitane te cobran un envío de 90 pesos por lo cual si solo quieres el bálsamo compralo aquí te saldra mucho más económico"
"The skin on my lips is a bit delicate and dries out very easily. Add to that I live in an arid climate which only exacerbates the problem. When I feel any tough or dead skin on my lips I have the nervous habit of using my teeth to nip at it, which only makes it thicker and more callous. I then use paraben-based lip products to try to heal and soften the skin- but it only covers the thick skin. Then when the paraben wears off the skin is a bit softer and more willing to come off, and again I nip at the edges trying to remove the dead skin. This becomes a vicious cycle and has been something of a problem. People would catch me nipping at my lips and wonder what the heck I was doing! So I. Tried HARD to resist the urge to nip in front of people or to hide it. Then that inevitable moment when you go too far and break the skin or a crack starts. UGH!!I even tried various exfoliants to remove this skin, but the nervous habit remained. I went so far as to use my coffee grinds with honey to exfoliate, then immediately moisturize and try to seal the skin. I even resorted to experimenting with different hand lotions AND THEN lip balm after exfoliating. This has helped, but it's also rough on my lips and is a lot of work to do. I have to do this 2-3 times a day to just maintain having not-quite cracked lips! I needed this to stop! So I tried to just outright break the habit of nipping at it and just keep them treated and late them just HEAL. I was doing pretty well for like five days, but any time I would get nervous or feel dead skin... it's like a nervous tick. I do it without thinking and catch myself. But the damage was done. Then again with exfoliating and moisturizing. The vicious cycle continued.So I set out to really do some research, and this product consistently came up as a solution. Well, I've only been using it for two weeks now and my lips are 95% better. Any time I feel the need to nip I just apply this. I still have to exfoliate maybe twice a week, but every time I go to nip I find there's virtually nothing to nip at! My lips are fully healed and they're finally soft again. The tough skin is nearly all gone! This stuff seems to both penetrate and protect the surface. It's quickly getting to a point that I no longer have to think about my lips. If I feel the urge to nip I just apply this and pretty much forget about it and move on with my day.Hopefully this helps someone else. It's weird to be sort of excited something so trivial, but sometimes it's the small victories!"
"The Jack Black Intense Therapy Lip Balm is nothing short of a revelation for those of us who demand top-tier lip care. This 0.25 oz. wonder is more than just your average balm—it’s a multi-tasking, hydrating savior that feels like a spa treatment for your lips. Infused with SPF 25, it offers stellar protection against the harshest elements, whether you're basking in the sun or braving the wind and cold. Say goodbye to chapped lips and hello to long-lasting moisture!The formula itself is decadently rich, boasting natural ingredients like shea butter and avocado oil that coat the lips in a nourishing, non-greasy layer. The texture is silky, gliding on effortlessly, leaving your lips hydrated without feeling heavy or waxy. Plus, the hint of mint adds a refreshing tingle that feels invigorating.For beauty aficionados, this balm is the skincare equivalent of finding a unicorn. It’s a powerhouse of hydration that not only protects your lips from the elements but also leaves them feeling smoother, softer, and more plump. Whether you're hitting the beach, the slopes, or just dealing with everyday exposure, Jack Black’s balm is a lip-care essential you won’t want to leave home without!"
"This is, hands down, the best lip balm on the market. I have tried countless lip balms that claim to soften lips and prevent chapping, and even the bougiest ones couldn't control how chapped my lips would get. Every time I run out of this balm and have to resort to a different balm, my lips are chapped within hours. This balm keeps my lips hydrated and a little really does go a long way. I am a forever customer."
"I have issues with my lips having a bad reaction to lots of lipsticks, chapsticks, lip glosses etc… I hate having dry lips but even just a regular chapstick with cause cracking and bleeding on my lips. These do not! Bonus that they have SPF! The peppermint is my fave!"
"4th time in a row, i feel like my tube comes half empty.. i love jack black but its becoming annoying"
Jack Black does not disappoint. This is my absolutely favorite chapstick. Most other chapsticks make my lips dry when the product wears off but this product leaves them soft with no need to reapply. My friends and family are now into this product!
This is the best lip balm ever I live in Phoenix and I work outside during the summer. I put this on my lips. I never have to reapply it in eight hours. It is thick. It smells good and it stays on. It does not melt off or rub off I can leave it in my pocket while I’m at work or in my car and it does not melt.
"I needed something to keep in my purse that was easy to use instead of the tin lip balms which makes a mess. This helps with that, it goes on smooth and makes me lips feel for silky and doesn’t live them feeling sticky or drys them out more."
"Gracias a una reseña que leí puedo decir que este producto es maravilloso para los labios resecos, me decidí a probarlo después de muchos bálsamos que he probado y no me habían funcionado. Yo literal, me arrancaba los cueritos de los labios porque se me desprendían un poco y terminaba arrancando. De verdad, pruebalo, está genial y me llegaron 3 bálsamos, yo esperaba que me llegara 1 y fueron 3.. además llegaron muy rápido"
Me encanta el olor y que tenga SPF.
Best lip balm. Healed my lips over night. I’ll never use another brand again
"Muy bueno, entrega a tiempo."
"Descubrí esta marca hace poco y me impresionó por lo que decidí probar este bálsamo ya que siempre he sufrido de resequedad en los labios.Desde el primer día de uso sentí la diferencia, una mínima cantidad es suficiente para hidratar los labios, este tiene un sabor neutro y tiene un ligero olor a menta, lo que más me gustó es que no se siente para nada aceitoso.Lo recomiendo mucho, el precio está un poco elevado para ser un bálsamo pero rinde mucho."
my lips are not dry any longer. this is the second purchase and I will continue to buy this lip moisturizer. love love live it.
Works better than any chapstick type product I’ve ever used. Leaves lips soft and works well under lipstick or over. Great for overnight. Use frequently and cleared up my dry lips in two days!
De los mejores bálsamos labiales que he probado.
The only lip balm I don't have to constantly reapply. I've tried dozens of lip balms and this is the only one I've found that works for me. Good duration and doesn't dry out my lips. Has a very mild (and good) scent. Thumbs up. I love this product.
This item was ok on my lips. This item did stay on my lips more than normal stuff would. It feels real good on your lips. Yes I would buy these again.
I love this brant and was very excited to see that they had a lip balm/chapstick to try. I did purchase the two pack and I love it. Will be buying again.
I love the smell of this product and the feel on my lips. Lots of other chapsticks don't do much for me but this actually gives me results. This is my favorite!
I bought twin pack twice already. Saves me and my lips every winter. Definitely the best
"No matter how much layers I put, it doesn't moisturise well at all, do not recommend at all"
ما استغنى عنه لترطيب شفايفي يخلي الشفايف ناعمه
i have yet to use it. let’s hope it doesn’t disappoint 😂😂…update: IT SMELLS SO GOOD! like vanilla 😍wow! the application is amazing! the formula is a little on the thicker side tho. as for the color and how it feels on my lips!!! IN LOVE! def worth the price i guesss😭😂
"I love the flavor of these and the buttery smooth texture. I wish the color was a little more prominent, but still worth the 5 stars."
One of the best lip products ever so buttery and so nice
Mint is the best one yet- had a clear but still shimmery finish that makes a little better than a clear gloss- but nearly clear.
"Like the product a lot, but pricey"
I liked that this was available since it’s sold out at a lot of sephoras. Lots of hype but it’s just a normal lip balm. Provides moisture and lasts just was long as anything else. Not sticky and provides decent shine. Pleasant smell and no taste.
I love this and will defiantly be getting more. A friend recommended this to me and its a great gift for people!
"This is hands down my favorite lip gloss. Pricey, but worth every penny. Very nourishing, hydrating, but not sticky or gloopy. Will be ordering more colors!"
"Me encanta el color, es muy natural. Poppy es coral! La fórmula es muy rica y huele muy lindo. Hidratante pero sí requiere múltiples reaplicaciones durante el día, como cualquier bálsamo labial!"
El producto llegó roto y derramado y fue bastante caro para que llegara en pésimas condiciones el día de hoy.
Es bonito el color  y la caja se veía ya dañada y lo pagué al doble que en Sephora. Me arrepiento mucho
Es tal cual está en la descripción. Un gloss que tiene un tenue color nude.
"Está muy caro para lo que es, lo puedes encontrar en otras portes como REVOLVE Por menos de 500 pesos"
"I have celiac disease, so I have to be VERY careful that gluten does not enter my mouth. I have been hunting for skin and lip care products I can confidently use without fear of a flare-up from accidental ingestion. Before EOS, I had to obsessively wash my hands every time I used mainstream lotions out of fear that gluten could be transferred to food I pick up.Along came EOS. I am SOO happy that this company has all gluten free products and manufactures in a gluten free facility (look at their FAQ) while also using certified gluten-free oats. This lip balm smells SOOO delicious and I'm obsessed with it. The tube is so cute as well. My lips are left feeling super hydrated. I never forget to apply this lip balm because I'm obsessed with the smell. I can't wait to try other EOS lip balms and products. Hopefully they start offering more soaps too."
"Love the quality, that is natural and the silky feel on my lips"
I can’t live without my EOS. I have them all over the house. The smell is awesome ! It really moisturizers my lips.
Great coverage and tastes yummy too.
"I bought these because I know I like the brand, and I usually love birthday cake things. But this particular scent did not work for me at all. I don't know if I got a bad batch or if  it's just not a smell I like, but I couldn't stand these. Bear in mind that I am very picky about scents to begin with. And I would say that this smelled more like a weird butter cookie than birthday cake. But this is just my subjective opinion. This brand makes great lip balm though, so I just bought the product in the strawberry sorbet flavor, and that one is very good. I think it all depends on whether you like the scent/flavor or not."
"I love this brand, it smells so good and it works well"
This is my favorite lip product.  I love the flavors....both smell and taste great.
I  use this all the time
Me encantan para mis labios resecos
After buying this I bought the mint ones too they all smell so lovely and leave my lips nice and soft
Not impressive! Makes your lips feel like you have a windburn. Not moisturizing or hydrating at all!
"If you like fruity and/or tropical EOS lip balms, you’re going to love these."
Feels nice on your lips and smells nice
"I’ve been addicted to The classic Burts Bees lip balm I think since a year after it came out! But I discovered this variation from Burt’s and I can’t stop using it. I alternate it with the classic lip balm. It has a smooth and silky texture, which is great if you bite your lips like I do. Or if you tend to be dehydrated… So by this and enjoy! It really makes lip care Just that much better! It’s very hard to find in stores, by the way, and when you do, it’s not a multi pack. So spend the money & know your  lips are covered. And happy!!!!!!!!"
This Burt’s Bees Lip Balm is the perfect chapping preventative for the cold Mid-West winters. I am never without it!
Best price for these!!
"Living in Minnesota, everyone needs a GREAT, reliable lip balm.  Already having very dry skin, I found that the majority of lip balms on the market contain menthol, or peppermint, or another ""cooling"" agent.  With very dry, chapped lips, those cooling agents can oftentimes hurt!  This Ultra Conditioning formula contains no such chemical. This has been my go-to lip balm for a number of years now.  I always make sure to buy the four pack of this product, because I won't use anything else. Even the worst case of chapped lips can be fixed in just a day or two. LOVE IT!!  It's money very well spent, and it does what it promises. THAT'S a rarity these days!"
Works as expected
My only lip balm unless I’m dressed up. Sooo silky smooth.
This chapstick is the most hydrating I’ve ever used. It’s not waxy or thick. Love love love it!
Great
"A friend bought me a tube of a premium brand lip balm to try and I liked it but I couldn't justify almost $20 for one little tube of it.  I have used Chapstick in the past and was looking for something better when I came across Burt's Bees. I often have a table spoon of honey before going to bed to help coat and moisturize my throat, so why not try something similar for my lips?  I was happy to see this package actually came with TWO tubes instead of just one.  I have been using it nightly for about a week and it seems to moisturize my lips as good as the expensive tube I tried and it seems a lot better than the petroleum based brands I have tried in the past. It has a nice light vanilla scent and I love the light vanilla flavor as well."
"I buy this flavored one, I don’t like the fruity lip balms.  I always have one in my purse and one on my counter. I use it when I go out the door and it lasts a few hours. The vanilla is a nice scent."
Burt's Bees lip balm really works to keep my lips moisturized and feeling great. It's the only lips balm that works for me.
"This is my favorite flavor!  It smells amazing, keeps your lips moist, soft and protected and it fits easily into pockets, purses, travel bags, anywhere you need a lip pick me up."
"I love most of the 'flavors' of Burt's Bees lip balms. Of all the lib balms out there, Burt's Bees seems to work the best at keeping my lips moisturized. It's very dry where I live, especially in the summer months. I go through a lot of lip balm. This is the first time I've tried the vanilla bean and I love it."
Gotta love the berts bees.  The vanilla is great.  Much higher price than competition cost it a star.
They went on so nice and smooth and made my lips feel soft and the flavors are always so good vanilla being my favorite
quick delivery
"Honestly,  this is the best lip balm I have ever tried. Have probably bought it 1000 times. My lips are really flaky and this is my only remedy to hydrate my lips for a long time."
"This is literally the best lip balm I’ve ever used.Will be one I will always use this now.The kids love it too, they say it smells like marshmallows."
Ya van varias veces que lo compro lo recomiendo. Antes estaba más caro ahorita tiene muy buen precio
My fav!!! All time fav lip balm.
5 stars for the lip balm everytime however I was disappointed that they came in an envelope separately in it and wasn't in a sealed packet like in the picture as I was gonna use as a stocking filler but felt silly putting them in as two wee separate tubes. Hence the one star off
"The smell is nice and the smoothness and hydration is great.  Definitely part of my *winter survival kit, LOL!  I use it on my lips, around my eyes, cheeks, cuticles, anywhere I need soothing skin moisture and protection.  Perks:  Non irritating, quick absorption, no greasy appearance, works with my make up (under or over), super portable/convenient, long lasting, and affordable!!!  I keep one in my car, vanity, at my desk, bedside, and of course my purse!  Better grab yourself some, before I use it all up😁. *Also a must for Summer Survival Kits!"
This stuff is the BEST. I use it as chapstick and have actually given tubes to people I know. I have officially stopped using any other lip balm as no others compare to this one. The quality is fantastic. It's smooth and hydrating and smells wonderful. It keeps my lips refreshed and has no sticky feeling. Just slides on like butter and does it's job. Plus the tubes are HUGE and last forever. I keep one in each of my purses. I will forever use this brand of products but especially these sticks.
"I ordered this without paying any attention at all to the size - I saw ""Palmers"" and ""dry lips"" and immediately put it in my cart thinking the tubes would be the same size as any chapstick. Once I received and opened, I was surprised to find it's actually multi-use. I tried it on my lips and then on my super dry cuticles. It's so moisturizing, not at all greasy, absolutely perfect for those two purposes and one tube will last a long time as a little goes a long way. It's totally matte on the lips, no shine or gloss at all, so men will like it too. I'll buy more to use as stocking stuffers at Christmas."
I LOVE PALMERS. ITS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS. NEED SOMETHING FOR THOSE DRY SPOTS. PALMERS GOT YOU COVERED. I USE IT WHEN NOT WEARING LIPSTICK' GOT TO KEEP MY LIPS KISSABLE. IT ALSO HELPS WITH SCARS. THE BALM GLIDES ON. IT FEELS NICE ON  THE SKIN. THE SMELL IS JUST FINE. YOU GET THREE IN A PACK. THE PACK IS NOT EXPENSIVE AND LAST AWHILE.
"Palmer’s Cocoa Butter 3-1 Lip, Face and Body is incredibly good! I’m very conscious about quality, taking into consideration, texture, fragrance, performance, safe ingredients and value. This 3-1 sticks by Palmer’s filled all these categories with a solid 5 starts. I had used many other products from Palmer’s and always very satisfied with my purchases"
"### 5-Star Review: Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Moisturizing Swivel StickPalmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Moisturizing Swivel Stick with Vitamin E is a fantastic product that I highly recommend for anyone dealing with dry skin. The pack of three is perfect for keeping one in various places like my beach bag, purse, and at home.#### Pros:1. **Versatile Use**: This swivel stick is incredibly versatile.

Its versatility, deep hydration, and user-friendly design make it a must-have in any skincare routine. Highly recommended!"
"Not a ton of product in there. Not good for whole body use, I bought it because I hate getting the cocoa butter all over my hands when I buy the tub of it. Would be great for lips or just touch ups on the body (hands, knees, elbows). I love the smell, texture, and outcome. Just expected each stick to last longer for my needs."
"Best lip balm ever.  It's great for scars, and dry skin. And it hardly takes up any space in your purse 👛."
Es el mejor para evitar los labios secos.
Hej!Testade tipsen med detta stiftet på rynkor under natten. Funkar väldigt bra!Rynkorna borta!
É o único produto que consegue tratar os meus lábios secos. Uso todos os dias.
Beste Lippenpflege aller Zeiten. Seit Jahren mein treuer Begleiter
"Exactly what I want from a lip balm, effective and long lasting."
"They purch ased the lip balm for stocking stuffers for Christmas. This product is one that you can always count on to be a quality product and do what it says. It protects your lips, it heals them and gives comfort to them when chapped. I use this daily as a protector and have been extremely satisfied with the outcome. I would highly recommend this call any product to anyone!"
I get cold sores a lot and they are often brought on by excess sun on my face. I wanted a sunblock for my lips and found the perfect one in Aquaphor Lip Repair. The texture is smooth and not sticky like some brands. This particular purchase included a pair of tubes with SPF and another pair without SPF. I wear the SPF when outside and non-SPF at nighttime. Recommend.
Like their skincare products their lip care doesn't dissapoint. I started using for myself and children years ago when pharmacist recommended.
"I am a Carmex girl. It is the only lip balm brand I have used for years. My dermatologist told me that this product was better for my lip health. I made the commitment to make the switch. I’m trying, but I feel as if I have to apply this product nonstop. It never seems to last. It’s also extremely thin. I’m also not super impressed with its lack of creating soft, kissable lips. My lips always feel dry - even while wearing it. I’m still committed to using this product and hope that I will get used to it and even start liking soon. I can only give it three stars for the reasons above. This is not a win, but I hope it will be soon!"
Always buying this for the entire family love this product!
This is my go-to year-round for lip protection. In the summer it helps to keep my lips smooth and in the winter it helps protect against chapping.
Excellent product and the best prices are on Amazon!
It does what it is supposed to do. It has no scent. I feel that I am using this with the same frequency as my Burt’s Bees. The BB has a nice scent and is less expensive.
"Es un excelente producto, llevo mucho tiempo usándolo y francamente estoy sorprendido de su efectividad, rebasó mis expectativas; lo volvería a comprar, lo recomiendo ampliamente."
Produkt wie beschrieben.Schneller Versand
La verdad el paquete de 4 es una súper oferta y son súper humectantes
Las compré para mi hermano que siempre tiene resecos los labios y le ayudan bastante
"Sin duda los mejores bálsamos que he probado, sufro de mucha deshidratación en los labios y me encantan estos productos además que una de sus versiones contiene fps ideal para cuando estás en exposición al sol"
"Usually I would buy higher priced balms or close enough moistures for my lips but after a while it would make them feel cracked as if they weren't hydrating it but dehydrating them. My lips turn dry very quick so I was a bit skeptical for this as this was smaller too. However, one small squeeze made my lips hydrated and it smells soo good. Have this for two weeks now and I'm nowhere near finished although I use this everyday - my lips haven't turned dry ever since then even if I don;t use it for two days."
"absolutely love this product. thicker than what I expected but makes my lips so soft and shiny and literally lasts all day. I only did a few touch ups after meals but wore it all day long! great for sleeping too lasts all night long! I received this product as part of a trial at no cost to me, but will gladly be buying this product in the future! smells great and no weird taste on my lips. Mixes well with my normal lipsticks and replaces any need for gloss as it has great shine and lasts WAY longer. great for lip stains too! keeps them looking fresh all day long! was really impressed with this product."
This is the only lip balm that truly works for me
Good but still haven’t found some thing to cure my chronic dry lips
Not too thick. No bad taste. Hardly a taste at all. Stays on.
"I have been using a different more expensive brand, and when I went to re-order the old brand the price had gone up again, and it was just ridiculous so I looked for cheaper option and found this. I have to say I am extremely pleased with it, it performs as well as the expensive brand in the shiny blue tubes for less than half the cost!"
"Because I did not thoroughly read everything,  and did not flip through all images and see actual strawberry in ingredients I just grabbed what appeared to be something basic unscented.Well it arrived packed looked basic did not say strawberry on the front . Open smelled fruity but still wasn't clicking I should've read ingredients.  15 minutes after putting it on my mouth is burning.Grabbed the box flipped it over and saw strawberry listed. Rushed back to check better here them I saw the word strawberry in the long name description that was so easy to overlook.I'm sure it's a nice lip balm otherwise but I won't be able to use it sadly."
Long lasting moistureI like it
"I am a runner and needed a lip balm that would last on long runs, protect my lips and not be sticky or overly glossy…this is by far the best lip balm I have used. It feels nice gliding on and lasts."
"Great mouth feel, relatively long-lasting.It can be hard to find decent lip balm.  Nivea is one of the better ones that is currently on the market.Recommended."
This lip balm goes on so easily and feels creamy to your lips.  Second time I have place an order with Amazon.
A favorite product of mine!
I love this lip balm and buying it in packs of four is expensive and I always have them at hand.
"I used to be able to find this in the stores where I live, but not so much anymore. I can't use any other lip balm/chapsticks or my lips get red and chapped worse than ever. Great lip balm!"
"They do work but it leaves a funny taste, and yes I put it on my lips but it’s just different. I didn’t like them but they do work for chapped lips."
Nice stuff
The chapsticks are an excellent value.  I saw individual chapsticks (same brand) for $2.98 each.  I bought a dozen for about $13.00  You can't beat the value!!
Good product!
"I use chapstick like it’s going out is style so I bought this to have in my purse, car, office, bedside, and anywhere else I can conveniently need one. Def worth the cost and you won’t have to replace as soon"
Very good product and customer service
Best lipbalsem without a taste. For more than 40 years it is used in our family. Originally these were bought in the USA during business trips but now I am happy that I can order them online
"These arrived quickly and are in excellent shape and individually wrapped. I opened one to check the condition. I forgot that mild familiar scent that brought me back years. Despite being delivered poorly, and so left on a step, in full sun for hours on a 90 degree day, these are intact and ready to use."
Use this for your lips will thank you!
Still good but it seems as if they don’t put as much in the tubes anymore and opening one is very difficult
"This is good value, but, unfortunately, customs is too much, and I couldn't accept it. Such a shame."
Venían todos derretidos mis chapsticks ☹️
"I love all of the Vaseline lip balms…ALLL of them, but my two favorites are the original in the blue lid and this rose one.It leaves my lips shiny, this one has the faintest rose hue, but most of all, the balm doesn’t leave a chemical-y taste in my mouth!  I’ve tried other kinds including Sun Bum - which was awesome, other than after a few minutes I would taste “chemical” near the back of my tongue and it’s disgusting. It wouldn’t be from my licking my lips, it’s just where the balm “seeps” into your mouth naturally from your body heat and it tastes horrible.These Vaseline balms are moisturizing, inexpensive, and leave no gross flavor in my mouth. I have a couple in my bag at all times, a couple beside my bed, a some in my kitchen."
"Vaseline is always my #1 when it comes to lip balms and chapsticks but the usual small containers aren't the best options for me when I go out. With this stick version, it's so much more handy and also very moisturizing."
I use religiously!!! I love how moisturized my lips are after and the pink tint it leaves behind is the best
"This lip balm smells amazing and glides on so softly and smoothly, but it does need to be reapplied a couple times."
"There is nothing to dislike about a handy lip smoothing balm. I keep one in several purses. I even gave one to my 13yr old grandson so that he could keep his lips smooth. I told him ""The girls are watching"""
Smells like roses. Healed my chapped lips.
"As this is in stick form it has to be different than the rosy Vaseline in the tiny tubs, but it’s more different than I expected. The color is a bit lighter and it doesn’t have the staying power that the other has because it’s a much thinner formula. It is nice that it is in a tube and goes on easily, it’s just nothing exceptional. Price was reasonable."
"Perfectos para humectar, no hidratar, es mi favorito para el dia a dia, no aplica color"
"Nothing, and I mean nothing would help my lips from the dryness of cold weather. There was always a level of dryness to deal with. I noticed immediately a difference in the feel and appearance of my lips after using this product. In just a few days I had no more dryness issues! I apply in the morning, sometimes again mid-day, and again at bedtime. It does have a little waxy feeling, but it is smooth. Feels much better than dry lips!"
I have had a chronic peeling lip for months and it started spreading to my face. I was desperate for a product that would work.  This stuff cleared up my lip and my face as well. I ordered it for my mother and she loved it too.
"Oh my god I wish I knew about this balm before! This is hands down the best thing ever for dry and cracked lips! I felt relief right after the first use, and it has this wonderful cooling effect. My lips have been healed after just a few minutes! I am so glad I found this lip balm, and I 100% recommend it for anyone who is suffering from cracked lips!"
"There is nothing too special about this chapstick. Its texture is a little different from others, but not something you couldn't get used to. It has a unique lip shape that I find allows easier application."
"I use this nightly for my lips. I am a lip-licker, and have tried many different types of lip balm. This takes only a small amount, and stays on all night, even after multiple drinks of water. I no longer have chapped lips, either from the weather, or lip-licking."
"I was looking for a product to apply to my dog’s paw pads to prevent/relieve dryness and cracking. Saw the product on an end cap and thought I’d give it a try. It worked perfectly and a substantially reduced cost over pet-branded products. Since it came in a two-pack, I used one applicator for me and am pleased with the results. Will buy again."
"I live in a very dry climate and have had a cracked lip issue for many years, I have tried so many different products & nothing seemed to work - this worked overnight!"
I burnt my lips badly at a soccer tournament and finally broke down on day 3 of recovery and bought Lip Repair.  I’m a believer and my lips healed perfectly in a day after starting to use
Yo tengo el tic de quitarme los cueritos secos del labio y normalmente los tengo lastimados pero al usar este bálsamo se me curan inmediatamente. No he probado mejor
🤎
"El mejor producto para reparación de labios. He probado de todo y todas las marcas, ninguna me había funcionado más que esta."
Siempre tengo los labios súper resecos y esto es lo único que me ayuda a hidratarlos y no te tienes que poner cada hora para que sirva
Muy buenos
"easy ordering process, quick delivery and great price.."
Been using this for years. Best product ever. I do not get blisters on my lips from the sun anymore. Highly recommend
"Not greasy, lasts a while and doesn’t taste bad. What more can you ask?"
"Confession: I am addicted to lip balm. Call it salve, gloss, treatment, tint, moisturizer, stain - if it goes on the lips I am an addict that always has at least 2-3 tubes of the aforementioned within arm's reach at any given time so like to think I'm a good judge of what's great.This product is not great. It is, however, good. Not great, not stellar, not notable, but good.I suffer from super dry lips, a condition I probably created myself due to always piling on the chapstick, so when I'm normally reaching for something to put on quickly, I usually land on something that's moisturizing, since dryness is my biggest concern.A while ago was surfing Amazon for more lip things to hoard, specifically lip balm with sunscreen to use on my bike rides, and came across this product. Was a few dollars more than other similar products but I'm a simpleton that likes shiny things, loved this packaging, loved the SPF, so ordered one.It arrived the night before a 2hr bike ride I wanted to use it on, so I tested it. Slathered it on and immediately noticed that it seemed waxy. I rubbed my lips together and did a few things around the house then went back to the mirror to see how it was doing. It looked great! BUT... still waxy. It hadn't melted into my lips at all. They didn't feel moisturized, but like the Blistex was still just sitting on top of my lip like actual wax. Okay. Well, it was cool in my house and the next day would be sunny and warm, maybe it'd meld more then.No. Hot bike ride next day, 2hrs of having to reapply what seemed like every 15 minutes and my lips were super coated, but also still super dry. It was irritating, so once I got back home I re-checked the tube and realized something - it didn't say moisturizing. It never did. It said Lip Protection. Big difference. And now it made sense, as protecting was exactly what it was doing, acting as a barrier between the skin on my lips and everything outside it. So realized this particular Blistex is NOT a moisturizer, it will NOT relieve dryness. What it does is offer protection, a barrier to ward off what would make the lips more dry.With that knowledge I altered the way I used it and have been happier. If your lips are dry when you put this on, they will remain dry, albeit protected. BUT if you apply moisture and THEN put this product on, it does lock that moisture in behind the barrier.  Bummer because to continue to use this I'd always have to be purchasing two products - a moisturizer and then this protective barrier, and hope one day they'll figure out how to combine the two. But for the rest of the tube (which I only use on bike rides) I've found a way to be happy with what it is.5/5 for its protection2/5 on moisturizing, but it didn't say this is what it did, so  total of 4/5, final answer."
This chapstick works great I love it  and it has a beautiful smell to I recommend this chapstick to anyone
This is a good lip moisturizer. It keeps your lips soft. I would highly recommend this product.  Great value for the price!
Keeps lips very moist.
I bought it because its spf 30 and its 80 min water resistant but it has a noticeable berry fragrance and it doesn't really leave the lips moisturized. It sets a film and kinda dries out your lips.
Great quality and the vanilla flavour is nice. Wife loves it.
Excellent
Good
"So I was reading the reviews and although it seemed like everyone liked the product, they seem to a bit of dislike about the smell. Some people describe it as a very strong fruity smell. Well I really love fruity smells so I thought it'll be fine. However I would not describe it as a fruit smell. I would say it's a very chemically fruitish smell. It's really weird. And I don't really like the smell at all but it only smells for like a minute, and it's worth it because the color it's just a perfect hint and it's really shiny and sparkly it goes on smooth it makes my lips look really nice. I love it and I'm totally gonnaget some in other shades ...I'll deal with the smell"
"Has moisturizing properties, better than a lot of tinted lip balms on the market from Revlon, Covergirl, etc. the tint is sheer, rather than like a lipstick. It looks natural and good for everyday use. The shades are true to description. This is the one of the only brands that shows you how a shade looks on various skin tones, so kudos for inclusivity and awareness. All in all, would recommend a try"
"This lip balm (joyful shade) is so cute. The shade is perfect for daily wear and pretty smooth in texture. It has a heart in the middle of the stick which is a beautiful detail.My only disagreements are its watermelon candy scent, I am not personally a fan of scented makeup products moreover did not noticed it was a scented lip balm. Also, I did not find it as hydrating, but it might be on me since I have particularly a very dry skin, so it might actually work for others."
"I selected the wrong color I wanted by accident, my fault for not double checking, but either way I enjoyed the feel this product had on my lips. As mentioned, it is sheer, so don’t expect any high pigmentation, however the pigmentation it does add is a nice subtle touch of color on your lips. The sheer color and shiny gloss doesn’t last for long on my lips, but I don’t mind reapplying it every so often since it’s still a nice formula and moisturizes my lips while adding that bit of color and shine to make them look nice. At first, I thought the small heart in the middle of the lip balm was for show, but after multiple applications i realized it was part of the product. I found that to be such a cute addition to its design. I did end up purchasing the right color I wanted at my nearest Ulta, so now I try to have one or the other shade in my purse wherever I go. Definitely satisfied with the first purchase I made here, despite my human error. Ladies, always remember to double check you selected the shade you intended to select hahaha."
"I love the color Happy. It's just about my lip color so it's perfect to just swipe on and go. (Although my ""Bare lips"" pic is more pink from having wiped off Joyful earlier) The colors were applied with just a once or twice pass on the lips before the pics were taken and not with a heavy application. I was hoping for a deeper red-ish color in the Lovely color, but I'll be passing them along to friends/family. The Delightful color especially looks like I'm cyanotic, LOL, it's not a good color for me at all. Ecstatic I can use for a sheer purple on occasion. So other than Ecstatic and Happy, the others don't work for me. I haven't tried Giddy, Cheerful, or Blissful as I don't think they're what I'm looking for. Hope the pics help."
"Pretty, moisturizing, buildable color. I have fairish skin, grey hair, and almost no color in my lips, so Ecstatic is not too dark. Wears something in between a glove-box lip balm and a good gloss.  Has a slight taste that I'm not keen about, not unpleasant but noticeable. Wish too that we could get away with all these plastic landfill-fillers. Otherwise a nice product. I tend to lose inexpensive lipsticks, so am here to buy another."
My absolute favorite lip product of all time! It is the perfect shade and tint for me and leaves my lips feeling soft and moisturized. I've bought this four times already and will keep buying it!
I applied this over my matte color and it hydrated and brightened my lips. It's also great for a quick touch up!
"Love this product.  Not sticky or drying, nice subtle colour, goes on smooth and has staying power.  Will definitely buy again."
"Me gustó el color, es cremoso y se siente hidratante"
"Está muy humectante con un ligero color, si lo recomiendo"
it's not really moisturizing and i got the wrong shade but i actually liked it so i didn't return it and it has a nice color payoff
"Huele muy rico, el tono es lindo y da brillo.Si no quieres usar labial pero que tus labios tengan brillo este es el producto perfecto. Y también es humectante."
"I tried a new lipstick brand few months back, that caused a minor reaction and left a small dry, white patch over a side on my upper lip. I tried everything from hydrocortisone creams to different lip balms and nothing worked. Prior to trying this, Aquaphor was my go to on lips and I like it even now so this having the same consistency I thought I'd give it a try. And also one of the reviewers with a similar problem had given a good feedback (that's another reason I'm writing mine , hoping it may help others in similar situation). Now two weeks later the dry patch over my lip is healing well and I will keep using this! Thank you, Lord Jesus!"
Decided to give this a try and I’m glad I did. My lips feel super soft after a few hours of wear. It feels light and the strawberry taste is pleasant.
I’ve been buying this brand for years now and these are just perfect. I bring them literally everywhere and it’s just so amazing because the perfectly fit in my bag while still being such a amazing product that moistures my lips so well
I like how this product feels on my lips.
"rounded up to 4 stars because it really is a good product. my lips get so dry as soon as the weather starts to turn dry. this stuff rescued my lips in a day, however I continued to use it and after a few days it felt like they got worse, so I switched to my usual burts bees and all was okay. They got really dry again this past week, so I used the EOS lip repair and within a few uses they weren't dry and burning anymore, now I know to use my regular chapstick after the lip repair has done its job, guess the good news is, it'll last forever!"
love how smooth this lip balm is and super moisturizing!
"I purchased a ColourPop lip stain & I only had it on for about 20 minutes too see the color on my lips, and the next morning my upper lip felt weird. The center of my upper lip was numb & the skin felt tight & dry. I do have a sensitive skin, but my lips have never had an adverse reaction to lip products before. Fast forward to me now trying to repair this dry area on my top lip. Its going on a couple of weeks now & the Aquaphor lip Protestant isnt doing much! I just got and applied the Eos & it already feels thicker, more moisturizing & I have high hopes. I'm going to try a moisturizing lip scrub too. I hope it gets better. 🤞"
"On my Subscribe & Save order every month. I have them stashed around the house, in my purses & the office so I always have one handy."
"I have re-ordered several times, love!!"
I always use Liedix for anything mouth. My husband just passed and before he did I spread this on his dry tongue. It’s the BEST.
I love these  lip blistex . They make my lips feel so soft .
Rec exactly as described.  Thanks for the prompt shipping.
Love this stuff
I have very dry skin and lips even though I drink only water all day long. It's from a prescription. I use lip medex every morning and every night before I go to bed. Have been using this for 25 years and will continue for the rest of my life. Lip medex is the best and Amazon has best price as drug stores are over $3 just for 1 jar.
"I've been using this lip balm for years every night before bed, it's the best. It keep my moisturized and during times when i'm biting my lip a lot, this heals me overnight. It also (at least I believe) keeps cold sores away because when I've stopped using it for a period of time, I will occasionally get one.My dermatologist asked me what I use because she thinks I've had lip filler since my lips have no wrinkling and are super soft and I tell her I swear by the medicated Blistex in the little blue jar"
The best in the market!
"Overall a great product, keep my lips moisturized at all times."
"I’ve been using this for 16 years, no joke. One winter as a teen I experienced the worst case of chapped lips I ever imagined possible. Cracks, blood, inflammation…A coworker suggested this because it’s medicated and it’s thicker so it’ll actually stay in place long enough to absorb before it evaporates or transfers off.I will not use this during the day for the sake of my sanity. This stuff is thick so ALL THE PARTICLES will stick to it. Just like thick gloss. I use this before I go to bed and I always wake up with soft, hydrated lips. It probably smears all over my face while I sleep but I have no complaints. My skin is happy and my lips don’t know who chapped is anymore. We haven’t seen her in 16 years.These are usually $4 at the dollar store or between $3-5 elsewhere depending where you go. Sometimes I can find them at the convenience store for less than $5. This deal is 12 for $24 so that makes each piece $2. Incredible deal and these 12 jars will likely last me a good couple years. Am I worried that they may expire? No, they have lot numbers, no expiry."

Super humectante
"I used this product for decades.  In 2021 I bought the twelve pack, still have more leftover.  You don’t need to spend big bucks on some other brand.  If you use this regularly your lips will never chap.  You do need to apply it regularly throughout the day.  Apply lipstick or tinted lip gloss over it if need be.  You can’t go wrong."
Best price around. Buy in bulk but I’ll use it
"Blistex Lip Medex is an absolute must-have for winter! My lips tend to get extremely dry and cracked during the colder months, but with just one use, this product gets them back to normal. I apply it every night before bed, and I wake up with soft, smooth lips. It provides instant relief and long-lasting hydration. If you're looking for something that actually works for dry, chapped lips, this is it!"
I love the way it makes my lips feel and I love the yummy smell however on occasion I wake up with kinda dry lips but that is after 8 hours of Cpap . I will continue to buy and use it. It’s really great to put on before going to the dentist to help your lips stay pliable.  Buy it! Ok ?
"People don’t even know that this isn’t just for your lips. You can literally use it on cuts, scrapes, tattoos, really anything that needs medication on to to heal. I used it on a third degree burn, and a tattoo. The medication in it heals it fast and smooth."
i will not use any other balm for my lips again. just this one. it is just perfect for moiturizing even the driest lips. i put it on every night and wake up to soft moisturized lips
I only use this blistex for my lips. It is the only one that does the trick. Keeps me moisturized and my lips looking glossy and good.
I like the compact size. I’ve been using it for years. I love it!
I love this lip balm. you are guarenteed healthy lips. Great product
This product is great!!  Goes on smoothly and protects the lips.  Well worth the cost.  Have bought this several times and always the best.
The only lip balm that keeps my lips hydrated & not cracking. I highly recommend this.
"I have used Blistex for over 30 years.  Compared to others I have tried it is much more moist and lubricating; therefore, the best product of its type on the market."
Love product great for dry lips
"Bought these as a gift. I personally love these for cracked lips they do wonders if you just apply it overnight, the next day your lips are smooth and lipstick glides on my lips easily"
My fave lip balm
They were just sorta loosely packaged in an envelope without any packaging at all.They're still ChapStick though so it's not the end of the world. It was just weird to get it delivered that way.
I LOVE CHAPSTICK
"Calidad en cantidades, me encanta esta presentación."
Safely packed . Great !
"I am a chapstick addict and this is my favorite! Isn’t scented, has a wonderful moisturizer and a spf!"
Love the product but I was short 1 Chapstick
"Product is good, but order was for a box of 12. Only received an opened package of 11"
It's the real deal.  Keeps the lips protected and moist. Works really well
"Some of the best, greasiest, richest lip cream in existence. I use it every night and often during the day. I suffer from dry skin and ezcema, and I wouldn't say this solves it, but it definitely helps. Just wouldn't use when I'm out in public because it's a little pot you dip your finger in, and, well...not doing that when my hands aren't washed. Wish there was also a squeeze version to apply directly to lips as well"
I had never heard about Neosporin Lip Health Overnight repair before but I had such bad chapped lips due to a fever I was willing to try anything. After Goggling to see what was there I came upon this product.I must say it did a very good job. Within days I saw a difference. I would definitely endorse this product it work wonders.
great price
This works! no more chapped and cracked lipsWith 24hrs u feel relief. It took 2days my lips we're healed
"I have recently tried a number of night treatments for the lips as my lips peel constantly.  Since this is basically petrolatum, I wasn't really expecting a lot.  But, this is very good.  I like it better than a lot of the lip balms out there but I did find one that was excellent.  Also on Amazon.  Burt's Bees Overnight intensive lip treatment is in my opinion the best.  Having said that, Neosporin overnight repair is definattely the runner up!  I am actually using this one now during the day.  This is a very good product and the price is good.  I was just lucky enough to have found an even better product for overnight treatment.  However, this one is hands down better than nearly all those stick lip balms that you have to apply every hour."
Best cream to help heal cracked and chapped lips. The double pack was a must.
Have purchased several times and will continue.Other items not so much
Five stars all the way for how it works on my lips. I always get splits and cracks in the winter and this saved me . I use it year round every day! One thing to be careful of is that it melts in the heat so when I opened it in my car it spilled all over. No biggie… now I know not to leave it in my car in the summer! I have bought numerous to leave all over.
I LOVE this product and their other product. This lip product once you put on it seems to moistens your lips admittedly. Nice cool feeling. Would highly recommend ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS
Great stuff
"After the usual unhappy selection of discarded lip products for dry lips I finally found this. It is another in the line of excellent O’Keefe products. My brother is a camper and diabetic. He introduced me to their foot cream and hand cream which work instantaneously.This lip cream lasts all day and is thick but not gooey. Environmentally perfect. I read landfills are noting an abundance of lipglosses and I know I have plenty in the car and purse I abandoned. These you will hang onto.I ordered on subscription and don’t use the others. One in bedroom, purse, tv chair, reading area, basement, not wasting.These work, read ingredients.O’Keefe is a company well used by campers and sold in sports stores. There is a reason why."
Best lip balm on the market!!!
Pleased
Best protection and healing properties of any other reasonably priced product on the market.
It’s lasts for about an hour. Pleasant taste but the tubes are small and thin. Easily lost.
"I started using this when I was on accutane, and I never went back. Using other chapsticks actually annoys me. This is super long-wearing and I love the minty feel on the lips. There is a scent free option if you need. I would be a brand ambassador at this point, I am so passionate about these"
"Muy buen producto. Ma tiene los labios frescos y ayuda mucho a que no se deteriores y se rajen. Desde que los estoy usando ya no me muerdo los labios para retirar la piel reseca y he evitado el dolor de lastimarme por hacerlo. Es un excelente producto, buena sensación, buen olor y sabor."
"Es el mejor bálsamo labial que he encontrado, últimamente tenía mis labios muy resecos y craquelados, al punto de que a veces me sangraban, con este bálsamo sentí un alivio inmediato."
Es muy rico y te mantiene hidratada por muy buen tiempo
Recomendable
Me encantó conseguirlo por amazob
"This is the best lip balm EVER. I like it because it’s smooth, light feeling, yet very moisturizing, and helps to naturally keep my lips exfoliated. So, I don’t spend money on lip scrubs due to how this works for me. A local health food store chain had been carrying it at a decent price and I’ve been using it for probably 8 years or more.  They recently stopped carrying it and I had been to about 4 locations looking for it with no luck.I ordered the box of 12 and my lips have been missing this for a couple of months now and I’m so happy to have it back. I hope they never stop making it. I’ve tried some of the other events but the formula for the unscented works the best for me. Seems like something in the scented versions take away or add to the formula and I don’t like them as much."
Great lip balm
"I like that it’s natural ingredients. Normal brands of lip balm don’t work for me, I don’t know what my lip problem is, maybe excema.This soothing touch does the job for me leaving lips moisturized."
"I love this product, but watch out if it is sold by ""The Alchemy Collective"" (third party seller). They tried to scam me and send 2 tubes of lip balm instead of 2 12-packs, and when I left negative feedback they tried to bribe me with $20 to take it down. Reported to Amazon. If it's through Amazon or a different seller, I would say definitely buy it!Product review:I have a beeswax allergy so I have to use products without it. When my former favorite brand changed their formula I switched to this one, and it's great! It has a very faint floral scent from the calendula oil. It works really well and the large sized tubes last forever."
"I never go anywhere without a lip balm.  I've tried a lot of different cruelty free, vegan ones and this is just the best.  There is a slight problem with resellers sending only one lip balm instead of 12.  I've had to return this item three times now to get the right amount.  But it's so worth the hassle.  Your lips will be so smooth and soft and without any dyes, flavors, scents, or harsh chemicals."
"I used to love this chapstick, been using it for years, but they seem to have recently changed the ingredients, and now it's too greasy, i don't like it now... why did you have to change an already great product! Now I'm going to have to search for a new chapstick 😭"
"For YEARS I suffered with awful issues around my lips which after years of suffering and thousands of dollars spent, I learned I was allergic to lanolin which is in most chapsticks.  After the angel dermatologist figured it out, I cut out all lanolin. Let’s also add in I’m a chapstick ADDICT. I go through a tremendous amount and threw away hundreds and donated unopened cases. After THAY  I tested EVERYTHING non lanolin that I could get my chubby little hands on and these are by far the BEST.  I have been using this product and other flavors for years I constantly buy these cases - they are very long lasting I just have a problem lol. Don’t think about it just buy it! You’re welcome."
"I don't know if the product was expired, or just how it was, so I'm giving it 2 stars. Has an off flavor. Package sticker labeled from seller 'Seizee' also removed the lot/expiration numbers so I couldn't tell if it was old."
I’ve tried tons of others but always stick to this one!
It’s everything they say it will do. Awesome lip balm.
My lips were cracking bloody and pealing. Nothing worked until this. My lips are soft and feel normal again and it only took a few days. I will be buying more!
"I do like this moisturizing lip balm.  Goes on smooth, doesn't taste and stays in place.  I just wish it lasted on my lips a little longer."
Hidrata súper bien los labios. Lo recomiendo al 100%
"I wanted a good lip moisturizer that would last through the night and I would wake up with soft, lovely lips. I really like this product. It goes on smooth and feels really good. With the ingredients I imagine it would do a great job moisturizing if I didn't have to reapply constantly. I apply it and within an hour it's disappeared and I feel like I need to reapply to do a good job moisturizing my lips. My lips feel totally bare and unprotected like I had not used a moisturizer. Thankfully I received 3 tubes and not 1 like I thought because I'm going to go through it fast with all the applications that are needed.Does it disappear because it's soaking into my lips and doing a great job moisturizing? Maybe! Hard to tell, which is an answer all on it's own. I won't be buying it again. Like I said I really like the product but it doesn't last through the night which was my hope when I bought it. I would love a longer lasting product!"
This product has changed my life. I’m in accutane and my lips had gotten so dry I couldn’t move them with out them gushing blood. One week with this stuff and they were back to better than normal. I will not go without this lip balm. Seriously worth the splurge. Leaves your lips so incredibly soft and goes on like butter. 1000000/10
"My favorite brand, love the quality."
I don't know what it is about the la roche posay lip balms/creams but they work incredibly well for me. I get very dry and chapped lips and a couple days of regularly using this balm always improves them quickly.
"De tantos productos, este es el espectacular"
"Hola, un gran producto, he probado varios pero este es realmente muy bueno."
"I have very dry lips and a tendency to bite them, so this little lip protector certainly helps me.  Would highly recommend."
"Un buon prodotto valido e utile, se preso insieme ad altri prodotti della stessa linea si puo' risparmiare qualcosina che per prodotti cosmetici non e' mai un male. Lascia la pelle morbida e non e' lucido che lo rende adatto anche per applicazioni maschili."
"Been using it for around two months now and it is the best sunscreen I’ve ever used. Doesn't feel sticky at all and doesn’t pill or clash with my moisturizer (which is quite thick and has pilled with a few Korean/Japanese sunscreens before. It smells “medical” almost like you’re at a dentist office, and odd enough I feel more reassured because of the lack of fragrance. The faint smell is only there when you pump it out and apply it, then it disappears quickly. It has also made my skin look brighter and healthier too. I suggest waiting for the next sale and stocking up. It’s pricey but well worth it."
"My friend, a dermatologist, recommended this daily face sunscreen when I asked her what she uses. I've used some fancy sunscreens with wonderful scents and textures - and some cheap ones that also did a great job - but this one is just a great sunscreen. I was worried it would leave a white tint on my moderately pale skin - but it did rub in clear pretty quickly. There is also no scent (which may be good or bad depending on your preferences). Assuming it meets the SPF rating - this is probably one of the most pleasant-feeling sunscreens above SPF 30."
"This is the only product of sunscreen I trust to go on my face. It doesn’t have any of the harmful chemicals that other store brands do. It may be pricey, but I swear it’s worth the price. I’m not one to buy expensive products but this is my only exception. I’ve never burnt with this sunscreen, and it even smells nice. Also, most sunscreens leave a ghostly cast on your face, but this one goes on perfectly clear once rubbed in!! Definitely buy!!"
"This sunscreen is the best I ever tried. It’s non sticky, it doesn’t leave a white layer on your screen and can be used together with other moisturizers or tinted foundation. It last long and it is good for everyday use. Scent free."
On my last bottle the pump stopped working and it felt like there was still a lot inside.  So i popped off the top and there is a ton of lotion inside.  Can i still use it or does the sunscreen not work if it is exposed?
"Me gusta mucho que es bien ligero, puedo ponerlo en mi cara rápidamente y no se queda blanco, así que es bien cómodo usarlo si ando rápido porque no me toma tiempo colocarlo en mi cara, tiene muy buena cobertura me gusta mucho y lo recomiendo"
"This is the only sunscreen I’ve tried that actually works under my foundation without causing any pilling, sliding, splotching, etc like most facial sunscreens. I’ve used it outside in 100+ degree weather and it stays put and keeps me from burning. I’ve also never noticed any breakouts or skin irritation from this cream. Yes, it costs more than other brands, but in my opinion it is 100% worth it. It’s hard to find a sunscreen that works, doesn’t cause breakouts or irritation, and doesn’t create issues with make up. The bottom line is that this does its job well and it’s worth every penny!"
"What can I say!!! I love my esta MD sunscreen I’m on all bottle number 4! It’s amazing, very lightweight and does not leave your face white, I use it under my makeup!"
It is pricey but is totally worth it!!! The best…
Excelente producto recomendable
Very nice product.
جيد جدا
great protection and never burned and skin is good
Use this and nothing else. My tattoos are happy. And my face is too. I tan fast but my face will burn. So this stuff gets the job done. Pricey but so are my tattoos and my priceless need to not have skin issues ... Cancer ... Great product. Lasts way longer than 80 min even in the pool and not getting out at all. Of course follow their instructions.. I'm not an expert.
This suncream is very light weight and easily dissolve into your skin . It makes your skin feels nice and locks in the moisture into your skin . It is very effective you don't need to apply alot for it to work .
"The consistency is wonderful, easy to rub in, and easy to wash off. I recommend applying every 2 hours if you’ll be out in the sun longer. If you’re out in the sun doing sports, you will definitely need a reapplication within 2 hours."
"I was skeptical about this product because I have oily skin and it's very hard to fin moisturizers and sunscreen that doesn't add to the grease. I think this sunscreen does the job, when i use it my skin is not overly shiny and greasy and it seems to be doing a good job at protecting my skin from the sun."
"sunscreen is very lightweight, have a light scent, and makes your skin very moisturized after applying. Absorbs quickly to your skin, doesn't leave much residue, and most importantly does not make your skin feels oily. I've been using this sunscreen for 3 weeks, and havent cause any irritation or breakout yet. Easy to apply and very convenient, can be carry around anywhere. Would definitely buy this product again, highly recommend"
I use this almost everyday.  It isn't greasy or oily nor does it have a strong smell.  It's exactly what I was looking for.
"So affordable for an SPF 70 sunscreen!! Also love how it really doesn’t feel sticky and heavy. Definitely recommend this sunscreen for everyone, especially if you’re using retonoid like I’ve been."
good sunscreen for a good price. i have darker skin so i'm very wary about buying sunscreen without trying it out on my skin first but it works! i use black girl sunscreen on my face and this on my body and i'm good to go! water resistant and no white cast.
"No queda grasoso ni blanco, te deja la piel suave, no tiene mal olor, protege bien y no es caro, lo recomiendo"
"Hilfreich, wenn man mit heller Haut in den Strandferien ist. Schützt im Vergleich zur LSF50 Sonnencreme doch noch einmal deutlich besser. Früher gabs noch die LSF100, die war noch besser."
Really useful and nice product
"Nonostante la consistenza leggermente oleosa, una volta applicata la mia pelle la assorbe benissimo. Profumo gradevole e leggero."
Se absorbe en seguida. No deja restos. Buena protección
"I live in So cal. Every weekend I work outside building projects around our home. Lately I have been working on our boat dock. The temps have been over 100 and I work in the direct sun most of the day. The sunscreen works well, I never get burned. And the convenance of a spray application is far easier the rubbing in a lotion. After spraying the sunscreen on my skin feels dry and not sticky or greasy. I have almost used both cans so I am ready to buy more. Great product, it does what it is supposed to do in a simple to apply way."
I am a sun screen junkie so I cover us in lotion before we leave for the beach but when its time to reapply I use the spray since its easier and the sand is murder with the cream sun screens! Works great and no burns!
This stopped kids that don't tan from being burnt in a pool with a day of swimming more than once.
Love this two pack of sunscreen. Great coverage and convenient
"We have 15 of these things all over the house, vehicles, go bags for sports or whatever.  With three kids and running around, we just have these on subscribe and save the few months leading up to summer and through summer.  The kids have them in their junior guards buckets, sports bags, and I have them in my work truck and personal vehicles for my wife and I.  the only reason for the 4 star review is due to the plastic heads.  One fall and they can crack which sometimes can make a good bottle useless."
Always great quality.  Recommend.
My family and I used this for our trip to Mexico. I use a lot of sunscreen because I have sensitive skin and on bottle lasted for five days of use. I reapplied twice each day and my brother used it once so it’s pretty good and lasts a while in my opinion. The size is great for travel too and it fits well in any bag.
Always remember to put your sunscreen on.  Packaging is great.  Smells good works great.
"Zieht schnell ein, super Protection, keine Allergie"
Good price original
Good
Tres bon produit spray pour peu sensible et utilisation journalière
Easy to apply and works better than any other
"I use this product by itself or on top of layered sunscreen and makeup. At first it seems a little shiny. After a few minutes it becomes more matt. This is the product I carry in my purse. There are other Elta products that are wonderful.  This is my favorite. It is expensive I think. But, it works so well. In a hurry sometimes? Just put this Elta 46 on and add a touch of rouge on the low part of your cheek.Keep in mind you will want to touch it up if your day is quite long."
"I've been looking for a sunscreen that doesn't make me breakout on my face, every time I use it.  This sunscreen is easy to apply, don't make me sweat in the AZ heat, and the tint color blends in great with my light complexation."
"The Elta MD tinted sunscreen really surprised me! I was truly amazed at how easily it glides on the face and disappears, something that I’ve never seen sunscreen do. I can see why this is such a top rated sunscreen, it doesn’t feel heavy or greasy, it is actually so lightweight it’s hard to tell that you just put some on. When I put it on my face, it felt weightless, like a whipped mousse. It was so sheer that I put multiple layers of it on the first time because I was scared it wasn’t going to work. It did great, but unsure if I really do need multiple layers. Lol. I used the CeraVe tinted sunscreen prior to buying this one. The CeraVe one is also good (but spf 30) and is about half the price if you are on a budget, but the Elta MD version is superior and not too bad of a price if you can catch it on sale. It offers more sun protection and blends into your face ridiculously well."
"I’ve been using this more years now and I love it, but Ive never had issues with the pump until now. This time around I could not get any product to come out (like others are saying in their reviews)Here’s how to fix it:Turn the bottle upside down with the cap on and give it about 10-12 forceful taps on the bottom of the bottle. Flip it back around and try pumping the product again. This worked first try for me"
"I could be married to this sunscreen for life but that is not going to happen until they fix the problematic packaging.I decided to try this out, based on a recommendation from DrDray, because she recently made a video on the newly released Deep Tint version. I had never tried any Elta MD sunscreens before. But I had assumed this (regular) tinted version wouldn’t work for my skin tone. But I soon found out the deep tint is actually too dark for me when I use the appropriate amount. Turns out, this “regular” tint is perfect for me! And that doesn’t happen very often. It’s lightweight, spreads easily, and blends flawlessly into my skin. I usually go for mineral formulas but I’d make an exception for this. It doesn’t burn my eyes or cause blurry vision, and doesn’t irritate my oily skin. This has a skin-like finish. Consistency is thin and spreads easily. Formula is comfortable to wear, actually moisturizing, and doesn’t feel drying. Not greasy at all. Reapplying is a breeze when the pump works because sometimes it doesn’t. I keep wipes in the car to wipe off my fingers. The coverage is very sheer, not like Colorscience Flex which has more coverage and a higher price (but I also love). Some of my foundation colors in case it helps you with choosing a shade: Armani 7.8, ELDW Honey Bronze, KVD 063, MUFE 3N42, Haus Labs 330, Dior 4N, Nars Aruba. I use Tan in Colorscience Flex.I noticed many other reviewers have the same complaints about the faulty pump. The pump worked fine on my deep tint bottle. But this one took about 100  pumps, a prayer, and an unwavering spirit to get the very first drop out. Then it didn’t work when I tried to reapply 2 hours later. It’s working again, for now. But I’m concerned it will cause issues in the future. And this price tag is a lot to take a chance on it malfunctioning again in the future. I would not be happy if it breaks before I'm able to finish the bottle. I'm on the fence about exchanging it or returning it and waiting until the packaging changes.Edit to add: I decided to keep it because the formula is that good! And I haven’t had any further issues with the bottle."
"I am using this since last month or so. The sunscreen is non sticky, doesn't cause me to tear up which is a constant issue with most sunscreens I use. I try to reapply every two hours if I am in the sun for longer. I have pigmentation on skin so hoping this will be my forever sunscreen and help protect my skin, as I work through other actives."
"Really like this sunscreen, this is my first time purchasing this brand. Price is high but with tint and the fact that this does not rub off on my glasses and is sweat proof!"
The perfect tinted sunscreen! I was truly amazed at how easily it glides on the face. Works well on its own or under makeup. It doesn’t feel heavy or greasy. It’s also at a great price considering we buy foundation for the same without the added benefits of skin protection.
"Excelente producto, viene con color y no se siente grasosa la piel"
"I've been eagerly waiting to try the EltaMD UV Clear Tinted Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 46, and it truly lives up to the hype. As someone with oily, acne-prone skin, I've struggled to find a sunscreen that doesn't exacerbate these issues. This product, however, is a game-changer.Lightweight and Non-ComedogenicThis oil-free sunscreen is incredibly lightweight and silky. A small amount covers my entire face without leaving it greasy or causing breakouts. Unlike other sunscreens that have left my skin oily and full of blackheads and pimples, this one keeps my skin clear and smooth.Subtle Tinted FormulaThe tinted formula is subtle and doesn’t look like makeup, blending seamlessly with my skin tone. It also doesn't interfere with my makeup, which has been a problem with other products in the past.Skin-Enhancing IngredientsWith niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and lactic acid, this sunscreen not only protects but also helps improve the appearance of my skin. It calms my sensitive skin and promotes a healthier look overall.Price and ValueAlthough it's on the pricey side, the quality justifies the cost. I also believe it will last a long time since a little goes a long way. I haven't tested it for sports or water activities yet, but it's perfect for daily use.In summary, EltaMD UV Clear Tinted Sunscreen Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 is an excellent choice for those with sensitive, acne-prone skin. Despite its high price, its effectiveness and skin benefits make it worth every penny. I highly recommend it for daily use."
"Even though it might be a bit expensive, it is definitely worth the order."
"Llevo poco tiempo usándolo, pero la textura buenísima, y la piel, parece súper luminosa, además de estar protegida del sol."
I love this product. Very helpful in protecting my skin
"The dry-touch formula is fantastic! It goes on smoothly without feeling greasy or heavy on my skin. I love that it absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling soft and not sticky.I've used it during outdoor activities and at the beach, and it kept my skin protected from sunburn all day long. The water-resistant feature really holds up, even after swimming and sweating.The pump bottle makes application easy and mess-free, which I appreciate when I'm in a hurry.Overall, I highly recommend Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch sunscreen for anyone looking for effective sun protection that feels great on the skin. It’s now a staple in my skincare routine!"
"¿Un protector solar que no se sienta aceitoso, que no huela feo y sin ningún tipo de fragancia?Es justo lo que estaba buscando, no esta nada mal y de momento tampoco me a manchado mis prendas de color blanco, que es mi uniforme usual de trabajo, seguramente lo volveré a comprar, no tengo quejasCon otros protectores solares si me a pasado que manchan mi ropa y las deja inutilizables por el color feo que dejan y no se quita 🫠"
"I already knew this product worked well. However, I bought this two-pack because the size of each tube allows me to bring them in my carry-on luggage when traveling by plane."
"This is an excellent SPF for the price.  It comes out white, but it is easy to blend in and doesn't leave white cast.  You can apply makeup on top, but I would wait for a little bit.  The only issue is that it stings my eyes when I am working out/sweating.  Maybe it is same for other SPFs. So I have to be careful on my eyelids either not to put it or put it on and wipe most of it off."
I used so many sunscreen in the past but Neutrogena is the best. Even my mom also started using this. She loves it.
Used all summer on my face. Found one application lasted me all day when just driving and shopping. Very happy with this product.
"Works great, nothing else."
This stuff works as it should.  I play tennis 4 days a week and have fair skin that burns easily.  Most important to me is that I apply it to my face and when I sweat it does not bother my eyes at all.
Excelente  protector y además muy económico a comparación de otros
The product quality is very good using it for nore than a month
Excelente proteção nas zonas tatuadas.
"I have been using this for years as a daily facial moisturiser. Its non greasy, goes on really well and provides a sheer base for make up. Can't rate it highly enough."
Bonne crème
Every year we go away to the beach with our extended family for 2 weeks and spend a small fortune on sunscreen. This year I priced out the various products and bought this product on Amazon and saved so much money!  Look at the per ounce price and buy from Amazon!
"The Banana Boat Sport Ultra SPF 30 Sunscreen Spray is a fantastic product! It’s easy to apply, and the spray-on formula makes it quick and convenient for full coverage, especially when on the go. The sunscreen feels lightweight, absorbs quickly, and offers great protection from the sun. I love that it’s water-resistant and oxybenzone-free, which makes it a safe choice for outdoor activities.The twin pack is a great value, and I appreciate that it provides reliable sun protection without feeling heavy or greasy. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an effective and easy-to-use sunscreen!"
This was long lasting spray as used in Costa Rica for a week long trip and it kept me from getting burned.
Works well and lasts long.
"This is my husband's favorite brand, although I think he'd prefer the smell be slightly improved. He burns easily and therefore applies his sunscreen VERY liberally, so for the cost it's perfect. The product comes out strong and dries quickly. I personally prefer another brand due to a better mist/coverage and a better smell, but overall this product fits the bill and I purchase it every year for my husband."
Good deal for a frequently used product
Got on prime day for a good deal and would buy again
What can I say? Superb protection from the Arizona sun
"Easy to apply, quickly absorbed as is light. I have easy to tan but sensitive skin and will buy again though a little more expensive"
Great and perfect
Im Grunde hasse ich Sonnencreme / -milch.Aber dieses produkt ist der Hammer!!!Schmiert nicht! Einfach in der Anwendung. Angenehmer Geruch.Zieht fix ein.Schützt vor Sonnenbrand.:)
"Ormai uso solo queste creme, comode da mettere e non si appiccica la sabbia. Prodotto arrivato subito, integro e puntuale"
Lovely sun cream to use. Spray it on and leave. Smells great too.
Works great and smells good to boot. Our favorite sunscreen
I’ve been buying this sunblock for years because it rubs in well. I also like how it leaves a little shimmer on your skin so you can see that it’s been applied (in case the hot sun made you forget ha!). The smell is nice and it’s not as thick and pasty was some sunblocks. I also like that the bottle is somewhat transparent so you can see how much you have in the bottle.
Great Product
Lite and sheer.  Doesn’t feel heavy or sticky like most water resistant sun screens.
"Smells good, but very strong to me. Works as expected, and seems to be the same quality as always."
"I like it, smells good & works"
I absolutely love this sunscreen. Absolutely no white cast on my tan skin and it makes it so glowy and smooth! I use this to do facial massages as well and it’s perfect for draining my face down or wtv. It smells amazing too! Always get told my makeup is pretty but I don’t even wear makeup it’s just the sunscreen 😛😛
Don't go outside without your sunscreen!
Another good sunscreen.  Just not a fan of the coconut smell.
Ich hatte die Sonnencreme in Amerika und kann nicht ohne 😊
"Huele genial, no es pegajosa y proteje muy bien del sol."
"The scent is amazing, not too strong coconut smell. It absorbs really well and doesn't feel oily or greasy. It has a very very subtle shimmer. This is by far my favorite sunscreen and use it almost daily."
Super crème. Elle sent bon et laisse la peau satinée. Aucune traces blanches après la baignade ni même après l'application. Le flacon est très pratique.
Great product it works.
Great but slow ship
"I like that this sunscreen sprays white and turns clear fast, so you know where you sprayed. I have sensitive skin and I didn’t have any eczema rashes with this sun screen which is a total win for me!"
Spray sunscreen is my favorite kind of sunscreen as it is low mess and easy to apply. This spray withstands sweating and dips in the pool or ocean.
This consistently sprays well (some other sprayers become difficult to push down or clog). I’ve also found it sprays out a good coat of product to rub in. No skin irritation in even sensitive skin.
Convenient way to buy our sunscreen in the midst of prepping for a vacation.
Sunscreen for a great price and free ship. Woo hoo
Bought this for my husband and daughter to use at summer camp. We usually use regular suntan lotion but wanted this for ease of use. It kept them protected from the sun for the week.
Great protection during sport or hiking.  I have been using it for 15 years now and love it.
Great sunscreen! Kept me from getting burnt many times.
The product is excellent and work good in the skin.
"The dual Copportone package was overwrapped with plastic, but inside both individual sunscreen containers were scratched on the front and back sides.  It feels like the product was abused in storage.  The product seems unadultered."
Love these. Stay on well. They do sometimes leave a white cast tho.
We liked that it was easy to put on and non greasy
"I arrived on time, thanks"
Only buy this brand
Llegó en el tiempo indicado y bien sellado
"cumple con su cometido, pero si es algo espeso, grasoso y lo de siempre."
Considero que un súper producto a un buen precio
"Excelente bloqueador, cobertura ligera, durabilidad"
"Excelente producto, lo utilizo para actividades deportivas de mi hijo de 10 años y le otorga optimo grado de protección"
"I’ve been using the La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Sunscreen SPF 100 for a few months now, and I am thoroughly impressed. As someone with sensitive skin, finding a sunscreen that doesn’t cause irritation or breakouts has always been a challenge. This product, however, has exceeded my expectations.Pros:Gentle on Sensitive Skin: This sunscreen is formulated without fragrances and parabens, making it ideal for sensitive skin. I haven’t experienced any irritation or redness since I started using it.Broad Spectrum Protection: It offers broad-spectrum SPF 100 protection, which is essential for shielding my skin from both UVA and UVB rays.Lightweight and Non-Greasy: The texture is incredibly lightweight and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue. It feels comfortable on the skin, even under makeup.No White Cast: Unlike many mineral sunscreens, this one doesn’t leave a white cast, which is a huge plus for me.Cons:Price: It is a bit on the pricier side compared to other sunscreens, but I believe the"
I have been searching for a sunscreen that was for extremely sensitive skin. Everything I used for my face burned even the stuff that says sensitive skin. I was using unseen sunscreen and it burned a little but kept my face moisturized because my face is very dry. I have to use Vaseline or Cocoa butter even in the summer months smh. My mom told me about this sunscreen and me some to try. I was so scared to try it because I knew it would burn and I would break out. I tried a little bit and when I tell you there was no burn no breaks and went on so smooth. My face felt moisturized it had a glow and did not have a white cast at all. I bought my own which is pretty pricey but a little goes a long ways and it is amazing. I use about a pea size and it covers my face and neck and did I say very moisturizing. I highly recommend I have included this into my budget and will make sure I continue to use forever. I let my teen use it sometimes but she has her own. She can use anything on her face and she’s fine. This is definitely kid and teen friendly. I will be ordering more
"I recently tried the La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-In Milk Sunscreen SPF 100, and overall, I'm very pleased with its performance. The texture is incredibly lightweight and melts into the skin effortlessly, leaving no greasy residue. I appreciate that it’s suitable for both body and face, making it versatile for all my sun protection needs.The high SPF provides excellent coverage against harmful UV rays, which gives me peace of mind during long days outdoors. I also noticed that it’s water-resistant, which is a huge plus for beach days or workouts.The only reason I’m giving it four stars instead of five is the scent—it’s not overwhelming, but I prefer sunscreens with a more neutral fragrance. However, this is a minor issue considering its overall effectiveness.If you’re looking for a reliable sunscreen that offers high protection and a comfortable feel, I definitely recommend giving this one a try!"
"As a redhead I need a high level SPF and you can’t get much better than 100 lol. This stuff hasn’t broken me out at all which is amazing considering I have very sensitive skin. It is on the moisturizing/heavier side, but because I have dry skin it works for me and I basically use it as my daytime moisturizer. However I wouldn’t recommend this for oily skin. I wore this on the beach where I almost always get a sunburn, and I didn’t get burnt at all! It also didn’t cause any irritation when reapplying after swimming which is fantastic. In my opinion this is a great sunscreen especially for sensitive and sun-sensitive skin."
"Love all their products, using this was no different. Satisfied with this product’s performance. Used at lake Powell and for the first time none of us got burned. Don’t know if 100 is really necessary but going from Alaska to lake Powell I wanted as much protection as possible and was happy with this product. 100% would use again."
"My daughter was recently diagnosed with Lupus, so finding the right sunscreen without causing a break out was very important. This product hit the nail on the head. The cream is fast absorbing, does not leave a residue and make her skin feel super smooth. 10 out of 10!"
"This seems to be the best available sunscreen on the market right now for someone with light skin. I like how it melts into the skin, so there's no white glaze or white spots. Doesn't feel greasy or heavy."
"One of the best sunscreens I have ever used.  Easy to use, non-sticky, and provides 100spf face and skin protection, with no white residue.  This will be my second time to order this sunscreen."
"Llego en buenas condiciones y llego lo indicado, el producto es de buena calidad"
جميل واقي شمس سهل توزيعة على الجلد
Good product
"si es auténtico el producto, es el mejor bloqueador que he comprado, la textura es ligera no deja residuos y no es grasosa, lo recomiendo 100%"
"La Roche-Posay Anthelios screen lotion is the one of the best.Very smooth, not greasy, absorbed quickly and fully without accumulating on the skin.I love it and I will buy it again"
"I love this sunscreen! It’s not oily or greasy, making it perfect for everyday use, especially when not wearing makeup. One big bonus is that there’s no offensive scent when applying it, which I appreciate. When I’m outside, I actually feel like my face is protected from the sun. It’s become a go-to product for me."
"This is the only sunscreen I use on my face. I've been looking for a facial sunscreen that I can use while doing outdoor activities. I run almost everyday, and I needed something that is high in SPF, but also moisturizing. I have regularly facial creams containing SPF, but it's always a low number. And I didn't want to use regular beach/pool sunblock because I don't want my face looking like a ghost. This Aveeno is the perfect answer to my needs. The cream goes on smoothly, and doesn't cast a white film. I only need a little to cover my face and neck. The scent isn't too overpowering to where you ""smell"" like you've been to the beach. And best of all, I can put this on in the morning, and I can forget about it until I wash it off at night. It's very hydrating and doesn't dry out my skin the way regular sunblock does."
"Sensitive skin here, work outdoors, constant sun exposure. Was recommended this product, but apprehensive due to breakouts and pore clogging in past from other sunscreens. This one is specific for the FACE. I use an SPF moisturizer underneath, then apply this heavily after. I am also a heavy sweater and quickly sweat things off. This is mostly water resistant, but will eventually need to be re applied. I only apply on a clean washed face to avoid clogging or breakouts. I only gave 4 stars bc it still has that greasy, shiny look lol I work outside so it’s an “oh well” but I could understand how this could be an issue for others, especially if they wear make up and/or work indoors under those horrid, fluorescent lights."
"As soon as I was my face I apply this sun block—daily. I’ve been using it for years. I’m 78, and I barely have a wrinkle on my face, without using any kind of wrinkle creams."
"I have tried many sunscreens before and i was confused to buy this before but after use i feel like it is very lightweight, easily absorbed and no whitening on face and provides good moisture so worked for me. My skin type is combination of oily and dry."
"I was looking for a hydration non greasy facial sunscreen and this is the one! It is amazing and it barely has any scent. I was worried that it would break me out but it didn’t. It feels hydrating without being oily. The only downside is that it is an extremely small bottle. Otherwise, I love it!"
I absolutely love this sunscreen!! It’s hydrating and it protects. Used this product heavy when I was in the Bahamas and it did not disappoint. It’s also helped reduced my dark marks along with the rest of my skincare routine. Doesn’t leave a white cast (if you put on too much it might at first but you just have to rub it in well). I’m on my second bottle and will continue to buy!
"I was looking for a face sunscreen that would soak in easily and not leave behind white marks. Unfortunately this one has a thicker feel than I prefer and takes a longer time to soak into my skin, even after what I would consider excessive rubbing in."
Se siente muy bien sin sensación grasosa.
"It has this very pungent smell and after applying it, my skin looks very dull (I go from naturally pale to 10 times darker than normal)."
"A really good sunscreen that doesn't cause the skin to breakout. A little oily when you first apply it. Can gently dab off the extra oil with a tissue, if necessary. Has a very pleasant, mild aroma."
It feels nice to the skin and the finish is not greasy
"Debe tener algún ingrediente que es muy abrasivo con la piel, por que al contacto con el rostro inmediatamente sentí que me irritó la cara. Lo tuve que dejar de usar después de pocos días de haberlo comprado :("
"I've had the SPF 30 version of this before and it works well, but the SPF 70 was cheaper for some reason, and I actually am supposed to use a higher SPF over a scar for the next year. Both versions are a bit runny, so you have to be careful not to drip all over, but it makes it easier to spread quickly. This is the one I grab when I want to apply sunscreen in a hurry. Both versions seem very effective -- never a burn, although I am not sitting outside baking for long periods, more walking and biking around for an hour or two."
I had been using some standard sunblock for a while and it was fine but it always felt heavy and I didn't want to use it because of that.Bought a bottle of this and it feels much lighter. Easy to apply and doesn't feel heavy and greasy
"Wife got this to use when we where in Abu Dhabi , Philippines and Thailand for vacation. She works inside all the time and even though she is brown color (Filipino), being in to much sun will burn her skin.  I work in construction, so I do not really have that problem, but I did also use it in Abu Dhabi due to the lack of humidly dried out my skin"
Did not face any issues in delivery but I dont really like this product that much. Its very greasy on the face but works fine for your body. I wouldn't recomment using it on the face because it leaves ypur face oily and greasy  but its a good sunscreen for hands and body.
"For an SPF 70 I thought it would be hard to apply and too thick, but it goes on very easily without much effort and has a decent smell."
"Definitely worth the buy. Went on several trips and used it because I enjoy being in water. Whether it be in the pool or on the beach. And I must say it stayed on longer than expected, especially for being in the pool. You may have to reapply a little if you are in the sea water tho. I noticed I got less sun burn using this. When this finishes, I'm ordering again."
I live in Florida so sunscreen is an everyday must do and this does the job. If I’m out in the sun for a full day I can be assured that this product will prevent me from burning. My husband and kids started using it as well. They always used the spray sunscreens mostly because of the convenience of them but were still getting red. Take the extra time to use this. It’s worth it.
"I love Neutrogena products Especially this one I love how it moisturizes your skin very nicely.It doesn't leave a white residue.Absorbs wonderfully With a non greasy feel. And it's non comedogenic( Doesn't clog pores). This sunscreen is very light, not thick at all.. I like it very much."
Se siente bien y tiene un agradable olor
One of the best
Seul indice impossible à avoir en France qui protège parfaitement. Aucun coup de soleil quand on a la peau blanc fluo ! Dommage que ce soit aussi cher
"Die Sonnencreme ist angenehm und fettet nicht. Also auch für Leute wie mich, die sich selten eincremen geeignet. Guter Schutz."
"Es muy buena, se expande bien y protege muy rápido.A mí me crea malestar en los ojos cuando me la pongo en los párpados, pero eso no es negativo como crema."
"I am absolutely thrilled with La Roche-Posay Anthelios Clear Skin Sunscreen Dry Touch SPF 60! This has quickly become my go-to sunscreen.Incredible Protection: The SPF 60 provides excellent protection against harmful UV rays, which is essential for my skin. I feel confident knowing I’m well-protected during sunny days.Dry Touch Formula: The dry touch finish is a game-changer! It absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue, making it perfect for my oily skin. I can apply it under makeup without worrying about looking shiny.Non-Irritating: I appreciate that it’s gentle on my sensitive skin. I’ve had no breakouts or irritation, which can be a concern with many sunscreens.Lightweight Texture: The lightweight formula feels comfortable and breathable throughout the day. It’s not heavy or sticky like some other sunscreens I’ve tried.Final Thoughts: If you're looking for a reliable sunscreen that offers high SPF protection while being great for oily or combination skin, I highly recommend La Roche-Posay Anthelios Clear Skin Sunscreen. It’s effective, comfortable, and has earned a permanent spot in my skincare routine!"
"I work in dermatology and get to sample a lot of different sunscreens. I also hate the feel of lotions on my skin. This one is a winner for acne-prone, oily, and combination skin. Ignore most of the complaints about residue/pilling. For the most part this goes on very smoothly and uniformly. If around the edges there is residue, it easily wipes away if you go back for a second pass. I think it probably is better for lighter skin tones in general as it leaves a very slight cast but with a good blurring effect. LOVE how soft and matte this feels after absorbing for about a minute, and even more so later on in the day you stay matte. Many higher SPF lotions, whether chemical or mineral feel sticky, even hours later, this is a unique formula and much different feel. Please keep making this product forever!"
Love this sunscreen.  It’s not greasy when you put it on.  Works great as daily moisturizer under makeup.  And the high SPF makes me feel comfortable being out in the hottest days.  I now have this on subscribe-n-save for monthly deliveries!
"The Roche-Posay Anthelios Clear Skin Sunscreen Dry Touch SPF 60 offers outstanding sun protection with a matte finish. The high SPF ensures effective defense against UV rays, which is essential for skin health.The dry-touch formula is a standout feature, providing a matte effect that reduces shine and keeps my skin looking fresh throughout the day. It’s also non-comedogenic, so it doesn’t clog pores, making it suitable for those with acne-prone skin.My only minor concern is that the formula can feel slightly thick when first applied, which might not be ideal for those who prefer a lighter texture. There’s also a small chance of a white cast if not blended well.Overall, this sunscreen is a reliable choice for daily sun protection, especially if you’re seeking a product that controls oil and provides a non-greasy finish."
My dermatologist reccomends this brand.  It's zinc based but leaves no residue.  Works on face as well as body.  I used it all summer on an excision scar.  I felt safe being in the sun.  Excellent product.
"It actually blends into your skin and doesn't leave a horrible white coating on your face like most sun screens. Light smell, and works very well for people who need a higher SPF"
"to my face. Or at least that's what it looks like when I applied this sunscreen to my face and arms. Either I powdered my face and body with baby powder or rolled around in processed flourThe white-cast of this sunscreen is strong or bad. The texture is nice and non-greasy but no amount of rubbing in will lessen the strong white-cast.On my pigmented complexion, I go from healthy looking to looking anemic and sickly. It's very, very noticable. Even in low light noticable.But it's sunscreen. It's for maintaining health not a beauty product.However, when strangers feel compelled to approach you and ask if you're unwell an hour after applying it...it's problematic. I haven't tried applying makeup over this sunscreen because I shouldn't have to apply makeup over sunscreen to abatement the heavy white-cast of the productThe texture and quality of the product is present but I am only using this product on days that I will be staying at home not seeing people."
"Es un súper protector solar, siento que actúa como un primer deja tu rostro suave, no se siente pegajoso, no te deja la cara blanca, no es grasoso ni tiene un feo olor."
"Ha sido uno de los mejores bloqueadores que he usado, piel sensible, no me arde, no queda blanco, fácil difuminado, no deja grasosa la piel. Efecto aterciopelado mate. No deja la cara seca y mate, al contrario humectada y genial.  Recomendado"
I like this sunscreen it’s not sticky and really work on my skin.
This product is not made for Indian skin tone! I’d suggest that you should buy a tinted sunscreen which doesn’t leave a white cast. I bought it bc it’s la roche posay but I couldn’t wear it bc of that.
Excellent product
nice
I bought this so I can referee during the day. The spray comes on evenly and protects me as I'm out in that Southern Californian sun.
Bought this to go on a cruise with in the Bahamas and my husband who is very light skinned didn’t get burnt once! Highly recommend
"Works great, didnt even get a sunburn after 10 hours in the Las Vegas sun"
I swim daily and appreciate the coverage and reliability. The size fits in my swim bag well so I never forgot to bring it and use it.
"Family loves this, doesnt smell and it doesnt irratate skin and prevents sun burns."
"Have trusted Coppertone products for so long for me, my kids, and  now grandkids. This year is no different! ☀️💛 Thank you, Coppertone!"
This is a good price for a dual pack of very usable sunblock that is easy to apply and has little smell.
Great value for a 2 pack. They spray nicely and do a great job at protecting us from sunburn!
Buena promoción. Se seca rápido y no es grasoso.
Ottime x me
We absolutely love this sunscreen ! We discovered it on holiday in America it's the only sunscreen my daughter can use everything else weve tried she's been allergic to . It stays in place in the hot weather and if you can get the factor 100 you need to apply it once a day . I can't reccomend this product highly enough.  We love it !
PERFETTO
"Your product changes and roll-out have been a hot mess. In this case, though, you have a great product that does exactly what it should do.Used this on two recent trips. One was a rafting outing where temperatures exceeded 100 for two and a half days. Another was a boating/floating vacation where the temperatures were just south of 100 for several days. Spray on, rub in, and repeat at least three times each day. Result? No burns. Not even a hint of a burn. Amazing. Especially considering that I was in the water on both trips, so subject to constant bursts of moisture (in spite of the heat, both were great trips).THIS is how you keep customers, Neutrogena. Create a great product. Charge a fair price. And . . . then . . . stop . . . fiddling . . . with . . . it.A highly recommended product from a brand that seems to have lost its direction in recent years."
"Sprays on easily, the scent isn’t overpowering, and it doesn’t feel sticky once applied.  And most importantly, it does the job."
"I have very fair skin and this product, when used as suggested, I have never burned."
"Sunscreen kept us protected.  Sprayer works well (no globs, no clogging).  Scent was mild."
It’s got a strong fruity smell that I don’t care for.
the spray only lasted 3 days but I have to say it was great. I was on meds that made me sensitive to the sun and when I sprayed this on I didn't burn at all the week I was on vacation to the beach. I defiantly recommend this sunscreen if you going to be outside for a couple of hours.
"As a fair completed woman, sunscreen has always been a MUST. I don't tan easily & think a sunburn is the most uncomfortable pain ever. I consider myself to be a conisseur of sunscreen. I've used ALOT of brands. Neutrogena has the best all around sunscreen products for all skin types. They are gentle, don't make your skin itchy or stingy when applied, and go on light and non greasy.I usually use a cream over a spray, but spray is so much easier when your chasing around wiggly kids. And I love this one! SPF 70 offers alot of sun protection. It's waterproof, so you don't constantly have to apply it. The bottle says reapply every 80 mins.... if you are fair, you should be reapplying every 45 mins MAX.I also have noticed that I DO tan when using this. But I've never burned while using it.Goes on clear. Not oily. Can be sprayed at different angles. Great sun protection.Highly recommend."
Value the price when get a promo :)
I love this facial sunscreen. It’s the only one I’ve ever used that doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy or oily. I’ve tried quite a few until my friend let me use her Elta MD and now it’s a staple in my skin care routine.
I love that it is fragrance free.  It works well and I don't look like a snowman by being white and it does not make my eyes water like so many others.Repeat buyer.
"Never used any sunscreen because either they are greasy or leave white cast! This one is the best one, doesn't feel greasy. I use it regularly either going out to sun or working at office."
"Feels good and I like the inclusion of SPF. Recommended by dermatologist friend and on display at my dermatologist office, so they endorse."
This product glides on the skin. Absorbs easily and protects from the sun. Wear this under your makeup or on its own.
"It is important that I have a sunscreen that doesn’t cause my eyes to burn. The sunscreen goes on thin, Soaks into the skin, I could put my foundation on top of it. Or I can buy the same product with a tint. Often I work in my yard in the summertime, This product does not go into my eyes caused me to have a burning sensation. Love it👍"
This works very well as a moisturizer and and a sunblock. I’ve been using it for a long time and I really really like it. Very good protection.
This is a really nice sunscreen. It might feel a tiny bit slimy going on but after a few minutes it absorbs and leaves your skin feeling soft and fresh. Goes well under makeup. Best of all no white cast and NO smell. It’s a little expensive but you don’t need much. I will continue to buy this.
Es la primera vez que lo compro y me gustó mucho. Su textura es ligera y no grasosa. Soy delicada de la piel y no me sacó granitos ni ronchas. No tiene aroma.
This sunscreen makes my skin glow so nicely while protecting me from the sun!
Also available in tinted version. Recommended by a very successful dermatologist
Exceptionnel produit
Il miglior crema solare 😍😍😍😍
"As someone with fair, sensitive skin who loves outdoor activities, I've tried countless sunscreens over the years. The Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunscreen Spray has become my holy grail of sun protection, and here's why:Pros:1. Easy application: The spray format makes it incredibly quick and easy to apply, even in hard-to-reach areas. No more awkward contortions to cover your back!2. Truly sheer finish: Unlike many sunscreens that leave a white cast, this one disappears into the skin, leaving no residue or greasiness.3. Powerful protection: With a high SPF, it offers excellent defense against both UVA and UVB rays. I've used it on beach days and hikes without getting burned.4. Water-resistant: It stays put during sweaty workouts and swimming sessions, though I always reapply as directed.5. Non-irritating formula: Despite my sensitive skin, this sunscreen hasn't caused any breakouts or irritation."
"Fair skin, red head here and I can barely go outside when it’s sunny without getting a sunburn.  So I always have to wear sunscreen and I hate the stickiness of most of the sprays out on the market. I have been a fan of Ultra Sheer Sunscreen line for years now. It’s super lightweight (even the lotion) and it works and you don’t feel sticky or feel like your pours are being clogged. This is the only sunscreen I will use daily and bring with me on beach vacations. And it’s reasonably priced as well!"
"I have a large lawn that I like to mow, but need sunscreen.  This spray-on product is the easiest to apply and covers legs and arms in seconds.  Good product."
Our go to spray sunscreen. Doesn’t feel gross and oily like other sunscreen. Has a nice scent as well.
"The spray is so so convenient, and the product is highly effective in preventing sunburn.  I'm terrible at reapplying, but this stuff lasted all day and was fully effective even in sweaty days in the open desert.While it did NOT create the dreaded white haze like some physical/ mineral sunblocks, I will note that initially it's quite shiny - that's the one star deduction. To be fair, I found my skin absorbed it within an hour. Given the incredibly long lasting high effectiveness, I will forgive an hour's shine.  Keeping this stocked in my home and RV!"
Yay! Neutrogena comes through for my delicate sensitive skin! I feel no irritation after applying this sunscreen and it truly is waterproof. The SPF of 70 can't be beat! I don't want to waste any of this product so I spray it into my hand and wipe it onto my skin. And it has a very pleasant scent to!
This sunscreen goes on easily and provides great protection.  I am super pale and it worked great for me.
"A mí personalmente 😃😃😅, me gustó mucho ☺️☺️😃☺️☺️☺️ es muy suave no se queda grasoso el cuerpo y me gustó ese protector much"
Great sun protection
Easy application and reapplication. Doesn’t smell great but does the job! :)
"In the description it is written that 3 units will be delivered, but I got just one. Secondly, no MRP was written on the product anywhere, which creates doubt"
I work at an elementary school covering recess duty in southern California. The heat and sun off the blacktop is intense. I have tried many sunscreens and this is my favorite. I had been getting some dark patches from not wearing enough sunscreen. Got those to fade and didn't want them to return. This sunscreen has protected me well. It is light and doesn't leave a white cast on my skin. Very happy with this purchase. Just reordered more.
"This goes one very lightweight. A little goes a long way. I love that it’s fragrant free, not greasy, and pasty. Leaves your face looking nice and moisturized. It’s perfect under makeup too.Only thing, be careful not to apply too close to your eyes because it will still and irritate your eyes. One of the best Neutrogena Sunscreen products !!!!"
"LONG STORY SHORT: I had a skin cancer scare a while back, and my cosmetic dermatologist has repeatedly told me to wear daily sunscreen. Evidently exposure to the sun is one of the largest factors in aging prematurely. I needed a daily moisturizer with a lot of SPF and this stuff is great.It feels more like a ""moisturizing lotion"" than a sunscreen, which is wonderful, if you've tried other SPF moisturizers with a high SPF like this. It goes on smoothly without a lot of excessive ""rubbing it in"".Smells a bit like sunscreen (of course) but not like you've spent the day at the beach.I think it's great, and will definitely buy it again when I run out!"
"This serum hydrates and protects without leaving a white paste on your skin, like other serums and moisturizing creams.  That said, there are a couple of downsides: first of all, you end up with a ""shiny"" look that takes a couple of hours to go away. Also, it is more expensive than similar offerings."
"I have been searching for a decent face sunscreen. All the ones I have tried so far either leave my face way too greasy, leave a horrible white cast, or break my skin out. This serum doesn’t do any of that. I apply it when I’m doing my morning skincare, after my vitamin c serum. It goes on just like any other serum, no weird cast. After I apply it I’m able to immediately apply my moisturizer and my skin feels perfectly smooth and soft by that point. I did read so reviewers say it burns their eyes, I haven’t had that experience. Of course I don’t put it directly around my eyes, but the other reviews seemed to indicate it would travel that way on its own. So my only warning would be, be careful with how close you get to the eye are. I love this product and I am thinking it will be my go to face sunscreen."
Creamy and much more hydrating than the typical coverage of the neutrogena “Healthy Defense” that I had previously been using.  My dermatologist recommended this with the 60 spf. And so glad he did. Definitely have switched over.
"This is such a nice, inexpensive option for face sunscreen. It’s easy to apply, doesn’t leave white cast, feels like a (thick) moisturizer, and is small enough to stick in a purse or belt bag for reapplication. The top also locks when you twist it so it won’t make a mess when you toss it into a bag for on-the-go use."
"I don’t ever write reviews but wanted to say something to warn others. I’ve been using other sunscreens on my face everyday for years and have never had any issues with my face or eyes burning from a product. I don’t have sensitive skin at all and don’t have to worry about things like this. When I used this product on my face, I noticed that as the day progressed my eyes were burning very badly to the point where I could hardly even open them. It was completely unbearable. My eyelids were red and swollen at the end of the day (after I realized what was causing this issue) and after rinsing, my eyes were still irritated the next day. I noticed my face also was stinging a little bit as if I were sunburned. I never got the product in my eyes just applied it around my eye area (as I always do). I tried it again about a week later and avoided my eye area entirely thinking it would solve the issue but my eyes were still burning. I really like the formula of this sunscreen, it’s super lightweight, leaves no white cast or pilling, makes my skin look glowy, and makeup goes on smoothly over top. It’s a bummer it causes so much irritation for me. If Neutrogena could figure out a way to re-formulate so the stinging wouldn’t be an issue, I'd continue to use it. I’ve resorted to using it on my chest and shoulders so it doesn’t go to waste."
"Lo recomiendo mucho! Es un excelente producto, no se siente ni es grasoso, deja la piel súper y humectada"
Excelente base de maquillaje
"El bloqueador cumple su funcion y protege tu piel, la deja viendose hermosa pero a un alto costo ya que si cae en tus ojos por sudor etc la irritación no se va"
"De verdad, no tiren su dinero. Es horrible este producto: parece que te embadurnaste aceite de coco y no se absorbe. Te deja la cara súper brillosa y hasta escurre (se me metió un poco en los ojos y no se me quita la irritación). Tiré mi dinero."
"I recently used Banana Boat Sport Ultra Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 on a backpacking trip, and it was absolutely perfect for my needs. This sunscreen provided excellent protection and convenience, making it a standout choice for outdoor activities.First off, the SPF 30 rating offers reliable protection against harmful UV rays, which is crucial for long hours spent in the sun. The lotion goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy residue, which is a huge plus when you’re on the move.The size of the bottle is spot-on for backpacking. It’s compact and lightweight, fitting easily into my gear without taking up too much space. This makes it convenient to carry and apply whenever needed, ensuring that I stay protected without adding bulk to my pack.The water-resistant formula held up well even during sweaty hikes and water crossings. I didn’t have to reapply excessively, and it stayed effective throughout the day. The lotion also has a pleasant, non-overpowering scent, which is a nice bonus.In summary, Banana Boat Sport Ultra Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 is an excellent choice for anyone heading into the great outdoors. Its effective sun protection, ideal size for backpacking, and water-resistant properties make it a must-have for any adventure. Highly recommended for keeping your skin safe and comfortable while exploring!"
"Been using this sunscreen for years  (at least 15) and I believe it’s the best brand. Soaks in quick and I don’t feel greasy/slimey and protects well. Doesn’t have a smell.  (I can’t stand the coconut smell of many sunscreens.) I haven’t had a sunburn in years when I use it as instructed. My kids and hubby use it, too. I have it in a pump bottle on the bathroom counter so it’s easy to use daily on arms/legs. Took these two small bottles on a summer vacation and worked perfect. Highly recommend!"
"Como alguien que pasa mucho tiempo al aire libre, encontrar un bloqueador solar confiable es crucial para mí. Después de probar una variedad de marcas y formulaciones, puedo decir con confianza que el Banana Boat Sport es mi opción número uno. Con su fórmula resistente al agua y al sudor, este bloqueador solar ofrece una protección duradera, incluso en las condiciones más extremas.Lo primero que noté al aplicar el Banana Boat Sport es su textura ligera y no grasosa. Se absorbe rápidamente en la piel sin dejar residuos pegajosos, lo que lo hace perfecto para usar durante actividades deportivas o simplemente para un día en la playa. A diferencia de otros bloqueadores solares que pueden sentirse pesados o dejar una capa blanca, este se funde perfectamente en la piel, proporcionando una protección efectiva sin comprometer la comodidad.Además de su textura agradable, el Banana Boat Sport ofrece una protección confiable contra los rayos UVA y UVB. Su FPS 50+ proporciona una defensa sólida contra las quemaduras solares y el daño a largo plazo causado por el sol. He usado este bloqueador solar en días soleados y en condiciones de alta altitud, y siempre me ha protegido de manera efectiva, incluso durante largas horas bajo el sol abrasador.Lo que realmente distingue al Banana Boat Sport es su resistencia al agua y al sudor. He usado este producto mientras nadaba, practicaba surf y hacía senderismo, y puedo decir que realmente cumple su promesa de resistencia. A pesar de estar expuesto al agua y al sudor, nunca he tenido que preocuparme por volver a aplicar con frecuencia, lo que me permite disfrutar plenamente de mis actividades al aire libre sin interrupciones.Otro aspecto destacado es su fórmula no comedogénica, lo que significa que no obstruye los poros. Como alguien propenso al acné, esto es especialmente importante para mí. Nunca he experimentado brotes o irritaciones después de usar este bloqueador solar, lo que lo convierte en una opción ideal para personas con piel sensible o propensa al acné.En cuanto al precio, el Banana Boat Sport ofrece una excelente relación calidad-precio. Teniendo en cuenta su eficacia y durabilidad, considero que cada centavo gastado en este producto vale la pena. Además, el envase de 8 onzas es lo suficientemente grande como para durar toda la temporada, lo que lo convierte en una inversión inteligente para mantener mi piel protegida durante todo el año.En resumen, el Banana Boat Sport es mi bloqueador solar preferido por muchas razones: su textura ligera, su protección confiable y su resistencia al agua y al sudor lo convierten en un imprescindible para cualquiera que disfrute de actividades al aire libre. Recomiendo encarecidamente este producto a amigos, familiares y a cualquiera que busque una protección solar superior que realmente funcione. ¡No puedo imaginar mi vida sin él!"
"I like this sunscreen because it goes on like lotion and doesn't leave a white ash on my skin. However, I am brown skinned and I tanned quite a bit so I don't really know how well it works."
"Comparing this to the Amazon brand sunscreen and the consistency for Banana Boat is so much better. They're both rated at SPF50, though this one is 50+, but the Amazon brand is much thicker which makes it harder to spread. Banana Boat's is a much nicer spread which makes putting on sunscreen so much easier. The smell is also great if you love the smell of sunscreen."
This is my go to sunscreen as an athlete. It doesn’t leave any white streaks on my skin and it leaves me moisturized though it’s too greasy
Been using Banana Boat Sport for years and years.  Its good stuff and works really well especially in the intense AZ sunshine.
I've tried about all the sunblocks there are since I work outdoors year round.  And I've found this to be the best.  It doesn't feel all thick on your skin and does a good job of protecting it  But with confidence.
"Buen bloqueador solar.Resiste el agua por completo. puedes nadar 2-3 horas en a playa sin quemarte solo quedas con un ligero bronceado.Asegúrate de aplicar bien en toda la superficie expuesta, porque protege tan bien que se nota la linea donde si lo aplicaste y donde no."
Es buen producto lo volveré a comprar
Haven’t had much sun this year though this is good for when we had some
"Bought this cream for my holiday, and I will come back with an efficiency review too.But for now I am pleased: expires in 2027, very little smell, doesn't leave a white film."
I bought this as two itens and when I opened there was only 1. Very irresponsible.
"I have sensitive skin & eczema, and this has been safe on my face, neck, and hands. I use this mostly on my hands, though, as I have another sunscreen I prefer on my face. It does have a non-artificial scent that some people seem to like, while some people dislike it. I personally don't care about it, as it's hard for me to find products my skin doesn't react negatively to, so I'm just happy that this is safe for me and doesn't leave a white cast or greasy film. It does look a bit greasy when you first apply it, but it goes away. It's my first time using Cosrx's sunscreen, but I've used their other creams & snail mucin products before and find the brand trustworthy overall. Also I don't know if anyone else has noticed it but the cap is really easy to twist off/on so that's cool too. Everyone's skin reacts differently, so do a patch test first"
"This sunscreen is exactly what I’ve been looking for to replace my laneige hydro sunscreen. This is very moisturizing and gives you a nice, healthy looking glow. I use this in place of moisturizer in the am. You might think this is greasy if you prefer matte finish, but if you like a hydrated glow, buy it. Oh and no white cast. I am a deep ebony complexion. Cos rx wins again."
"As a black person, I hate having to get sunscreen due to how it makes me look “weird” with white residue on my face.With this sunscreen, I don’t have to worry about that, and it smells really good.I feel as though it is better than some of the brands that are at my local grocery and beauty stores."
"First thing I must say, I am very oily, and that also comes with acne prone.  I love how this feels and looks on my face, not greasy, not shiny, no white cast, absorbs quickly.  However, my eyes would be burning and teary the whole time it’s on.  I put it on at 8 AM, and by 6 PM, my eyes are still burning.  I love it so much but I cannot continue to use it after 1 week of try.  When I switched to a different one, the burning stopped.  When I went back on it, there it was again, the burning in my eyes."
Ive been using this brand of sunscreen for months. Makes my face look glowy without makeup but also works fine under makeup. Has helped with my skin dark spots and scaring. Lasts a long time even with daily consistent use.
"I wanted to love this as all the reviews were amazing. This sunscreen is just alright. It’s a very thick consistency and I found it didn’t sink into my skin at all. I have no idea what it says it has a semi matte finish, this left my face very shiny/greasy. My makeup felt very thick applied over this. I also have dry skin so usually I’m happy with thicker creams but this sunscreen didn’t impress me. Think there are a lot better options out there, especially in the Korean skin care world of sunscreens. I gave 3 stars bc the ingredients are good, it’s affordable and zero white cast"
"The way it applies to my face is actually really nice and has a slight white cast on apply, but oxidizes after a bit. I would say it’s a more heavier side of sunscreen, but I personally like a feel that is more grippier cause i feel it lasts long. Even with that said I really feel that my skin also gets moisturized after use."
"I wanted a SPF50 sunscreen after feeling like the 30s I was wearing weren't doing enough good. This one feels like it really works, it's protective. It tends to be more of a typical sunscreen texture, being a bit greasy and smells like sunscreen, but no white cast, and I feel like that is a small price to pay for sunscreen that does its job!"
And thanks for carrier delivery 🙏
By far the best sunscreen i have. Its not greesy on my skin. And it smells fresh.
"I like the way it blends and it improves my skin quality , good to go"
It's highly moisturizing cream but with the a great texture. Good for dry skin .
خفيف ع البشره
I got this for the smell but bonus points that it’s not greasy after you’ve put it on. Great sun protection that smells amazing & less expensive than the bath & body works Hawaiian SPF scent.
Good sunscreen that doesn’t break out my skin like others do
"I'm very pale and prone to burning. SPF 3000 is what I need, barring that I do wear a lot of sun block year round to protect me. This goes on smooth and doesn't leave streaks or greasy residue. I'm very happy this works so well and the scent isn't over powering."
"Good go to, smells great"
"this is a good option if you don't like the smell of sunscreen, goes on well and doesn't leave white cast! docked a star because amazon decided it'd be smart to deliver this in a bag and not box, it spilled during transportation."
"I LOVE this stuff. I bought it in Honolulu at ABC for the first time and feared it would be like the other thick mineral sunscreens you typically find. However, this stuff is incredibly tolerable and like normal lotion! Super effective and smells great! I now use this as my daily sunscreen/lotion."
"This is my go to sunscreen, I love how light weight it feels and how quick it rubs in."
Bought in lockdown
Fettet nicht und brennt nicht in den Augen.Konnte auch kein verlaufen feststellen und hatte noch keinen Sonnenbrand.Voll zufrieden 👍
Firstly it smells amazing and secondly I glad it didn't leave a white cast on my skin like some other sunscreens. I felt cool while in the sun for hours. Great product.
Para mí es la mejor
"I used to use factor 30 sport from Hawian tropic I thought I'd try this as better spf. However I find I sweat a lot more with factor 50 in everyday active, will be going back to sport range."
"Im Urlaub bei 38 Grad kann ich das Produkt nur positiv bewerten.Meine Haut ist hell und war 2 Jahre nicht der südlichen Sonne mit Meer ausgesetzt.Wegen der Hitze verbrachte ich dieses Jahr im Urlaub (Mexiko) längere Zeit im Meer und bekam nur ein wenig Sonnenbrand.Nachcremen ist wichtig, denn ich hatte die Zeit dazu deutlich überschritten.Der Geruch der Creme ist angenehm.Da ich bei bestimmten Gerüchen sofort mit Kopfschmerzen reagiere, war das für mich wichtig.Der Preis ist für die Größe der Flasche, ca. 200ml, etwas zu hoch, den bei intensiver Benutzung, ist der Inhalt schnell aufgebraucht.Fazit: Für Urlaube am Meer Test bestanden.Der Inhalt reicht für eine Person ca. 1-evtl.2 Wochen, je nach Hauttyp."
I struggle to find a non-oily sunscreen and you can’t beat this for $7. I have combination/ oily skin and I love the stuff. No breakouts!
"I found not using lotion on my face, neck and arms turned my skin leathery and lost a lot of elasticity, but this seems to be protecting my face. Over winter it does tend to separate but during the season it works fine."
"If we are going to a pool or water park, my husband applies this. Absorbs nicely and never gets burned."
El producto es pequeño a lo esperadoSu cobertura es bastante buenaNo deja la piel grasosaBuena durabilidad⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ por el tamaño
"Costly, but seems to stay on my face and head better than anything I have ever used. I am an extremely sweaty person and this impressed me."
"A great product, goes on light, does not clog pores. Might consider wearing a headband if applied to forehead. When sweating it will run into eyes which is not related to how well this product performs."
He probado muchos bloqueadores y este sin color es mi favorito
Good sun protection.  Non greasy
Es un bloqueador excelente salió muy bueno de calidad
Nice face cream
Ideal beim Joggen inkl. Schwitzen. Kein Sonnenbrand und nur wenig braune Farbe. Sehr gutes Schutzmittel!

"This is a tinted sunscreen that looks nice. I suffer from melasma so definitely use a sunscreen daily. This is the one I wear on no make up days, like for hiking or at the beach. It has enough tint that it hides my melasma but does not look thick or caked. Once absorbed it stays on pretty well.  I must wash my hands carefully after applying as it transfers easily and I have seen it transferred to beach towels and clothing. It has always washed out easily, but I think this is not a good choice for daily use and certainly not under makeup. It’s what I use instead of makeup, while protecting and hiding dark spots.  The color is supposed to be universal and works well for my medium fair skin.  I believe it also comes in one other darker shade."
"This product is INCREDIBLE. I will never not use it! It makes me look SO glowy.m which I desperately need. My skin is as dull as can be, but not when I use this! I cannot recommend it enough! I use this as my foundation- it’s pretty tinted so it’s a light to medium coverage depending on how much you use. So glad they finally have different shades because this one was a little dark on me. It’s also just slightly orangey on me, but that’s again solved with the different shades they just created!"
"I love this tinted sunscreen! I just received it today and tried it for the first time. While I tan pretty easily, my face typically remains pretty pale in my opinion, so I was worried this “medium” shade would be noticeably different than my skin color. That was not the case, and it provides the perfect amount of sheer tint! I use it over my Cerave moisturizer and didn’t have any issues. My face looks very glowy and feels hydrated after using it. I took off 1 star because packaging is everything these days… I don’t enjoy the way the product dispenses from the tube. It’s sort of messy and also didn’t come with a safety seal. I might consider transferring it into a different tube but for now it’ll do the job! I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a lightly tinted sunscreen. Perfect for pale or tanner people I’m sure!"
"As a guy, I assumed all sunscreens were just greasy and shiny. Then my dermatologist told me about mineral sunscreens and wow...no greasiness, no shine. I was a bit worried about it being ""tinted"" but somehow it blends well with my skin. I just like the fact that I don't have to feel oily just to protect myself when walking up the street running errands. I'll never switch back to the oily stuff again."
"I'm giving it 5 stars because it works so well and covers beautifully.  It's a bit oily, but not in a way your face will mind.  After applying you WILL need to wash your hands.  I need a finishing powder to set it properly.  And then?  Wow.  Stays put all day and no irritation."
"I have rosacea and I sometimes hate the summer months because of the constant battle between having adequate sun protection plus some kind of makeup/coverage to mask the underlying redness of my skin. Over the years I’ve become more accepting of just foregoing makeup application so long as I can keep the rosacea under control (which is the main reason I wear foundation anyways). I was hoping that this sunscreen would be a big game changer for me. In some ways it was: the tint was perfect and did not appear too dark on my fair skin, and also didn’t make me look ghost-like. In fact, upon first application I was in love!  However as sweat began to accumulate on my skin (after being outside in the heat/humidity), it was like the tint and sunscreen separated and it left my skin looking pasty and the sweat beaded up differently on my skin, which made it all too noticeable. I also did not think about how the tint would come off on my towel when I dabbed my face off (but I should have known that was going to happen Anyways).  As far as the skin protection, this sunscreen did its job and I did not burn, even after sweating and wiping off most of the product without re-applying. But after I got out into the sun and humidity (ie Florida in July) it left my face looking very strange, almost as if I had applied a liquid foundation or something on my face that was about 2-3 shades too light for my skin tone/-looking way worse than it had when I had first applied it that day."
The lotion has a nice consistency and feels good on skin but the bottle is too small. They should give you more considering the price.  CeraVe used to be more generous.  I don't know what happened. I'm going to start looking at other brands
"I got this is a tiny sample at the dermatologist. Didn't have my regular sunscreen handy, so I used it. When I saw the tint, I was ready to hate it. NO! I have ordered the full size and use it whenever I ""go out"" i.e., if I was going to use makeup, it now is sunsafe. Still use my regular white (which takes a while to be transparent) sunlotion.Love it...PS it is hard to get off, you will need a real cleanser at night"
"Me ha ayudado mucho, es de barrera física para pieles sensibles, me protege, tiene color y me ha ayudado porque tiene niacinamida y me cayó súper bien, cero irritaciones, lo seguiré comprando. Busque demasiado hasta que dí con este y sin duda lo recomiendo."
Courteous service from the seller. I received the product in good condition and on time.
"I switched from a really good chemical Korean sunscreen after reading about the potential risks associated with chemical sunscreens. I hated having to do this, as the sunscreen I used was perfect for me. I use a few other Cerave products that I'm really happy with so thought I'd give this a try.It's quite thick and looks like pure foundation but it goes on so beautifully. My skin can breathe and looks radiant and healthy. I'm fair skinned so there's no white-cast for me, quite the opposite - it gives me a healthy glow to my complexion. My face feels smooth and looks beautiful. My husband even complimented my skin without knowing I had used anything different.Not sure how it will look on people with darker skintones but it really is a great product. This is the first mineral facial sunscreen I have used that doesn't sit on top of my skin, feel tacky and roll up when I rub my face."
"Auf Grund der Zusammensetzung und einem Sonnenschutz aus Zink und Titandioxid ist diese Sonnencreme non toxic und viel besser für die Haut & Gesundheit!Sie hat die perfekte Dicke und deckt Feinheiten ab. Hinterlässt einen super schönen Glow der zieht aber nach einer Zeit ein.Der Geruch ist sehr natürlich und begleitet einen die ersten Tage, dann habe ich mich schon dran gewöhnt.Ich bin super zufrieden!!"
Deze zonnebrand is goed voor mijn gevoelige huid. Prinkt niet bij de ogen. Alleen de tint is iets te donker.
This sunscreen does its job well. My face never gets pink when I use it. It goes on smoothly and doesn't drag on my skin when I rub it in.
"I am just finishing my first bottle of this Amazon brand sun screen. Ingredients are the same as my Banana Boat lotion and it spreads the same.  Better price of course. I have a second bottle, so I am happy and would recommend this to others. The warmer the lotion the easier to apply."
"'For me' not a 5 star rating only because it takes awhile to be absorbed into 'my' skin. But maybe, that's how it's supposed to work! After applied, it seems to do it's job! Good product, great shipping!"
"Instead of buying brand name priced items I always consider generics. This amazon brand sun block has similar quality to what I would consider as name brand. It doesn't smell and the cream does on my skin well. I normally go through several of these bottles a year since I live in a tropical environment; so good for hiking, beach, outdoor play."
"I bought this because sunscreen is expensive. I just mix it with lotion and it seems to do the job. I also shared it with a few of my friends, and they seemed to be okay with it too. For the price, I'd buy it again once I run out"
"This Amazon brand sunscreen works great for sun protection and it’s a great value. A little goes along way, and I have not gotten burnt while using this product. I recommend that you only use it for the body though. Whenever I have used it on my face I have gotten acne. I will still continue to buy though, as I have started to use a different product just for the face. Overall, a great product!"
"My main issue with this sunscreen is that the thickness makes putting sunscreen on a pain. Banana Boat's is  lighter which results in an easier spread and less sunscreen being used. So overall, I'm stick with Banana Boat's sunscreen."
Very effective product. Works as it is supposed to work.
"I'm a white girl who's in love with this product and brand!  I have some chemical allergies that make it so that there are only 3 sunblocks on the market in the US (and only 2 of them sold on the mainland - one in HI only) which I can use!  This is one of them, and it's now my favorite of the 3!I love the FEEL of it - very slick and thin product, so it goes on more like a loose lotion than a heavy cream.  Why do I care?  This means there's really MORE PRODUCT per ounce than you'd think!  My other 2 sunblocks run out about twice as fast as this brand, since they take about twice as much to cover my body as this one.  It also moisturizes like no other - I feel truly hydrated with this on, not like I just slathered on a layer of plastic on top of my skin.  My skin feels like it's breathing, and smiling!!  Second, the back of the product says this is designed for high melanin skin; as a white girl I thought that would just be a factor I didn't notice in use - not so!!  I do tend to tan well in the summer, and then get pale and ghosty white in the winter.  This product brings out  the most beautiful tone in my tan!  I've never had a tone like this in adulthood - my tan has always looked unhealthy and fake, but this brings out the natural and glowing undertones in my skin that I haven't seen since I was a kid!  Third - I notice that I do well with the lower SPF (30 in the normal product, and 50 in the kid's product), perhaps because it's a CLEAN product and not full of junk chemicals like typical sunscreens in the US.  I've noticed this with all 3 of the brands I can wear - that while I always needed a 75-100SPF at the beginning of each tanning year to not burn in the old chemical-laden products, I only need the 50 for the first few exposures with these better products, and 30 ongoing throughout the season.PS - the aerosol is also incredible - sprays really well, goes on evenly and doesn't get gunked up.PSS - this reveiw was not solicited and I'm not getting paid; it's just TRULY that incredible.  LOVE this stuff - please don't ever stop making it!"
"I love this sunscreen. I just got into wearing it on my face, daily. It gives a nice glow to the skin and really is sheer. I appreciate the moisturizing aspect of this sunscreen. I use a lightweight moisturizer after washing my face, and then use less than a pea-size amount of this afterward.I little goes a long way! I’ve ordered the spray for an upcoming cruise to use on my whole body."
"Effective Sun Protection:This sunscreen provides reliable SPF 30 protection, which is essential for preventing sunburn and long-term skin damage. It's effective in shielding the skin from harmful UVA and UVB rays, making it suitable for daily use and outdoor activities.No White Residue:One of the standout features of this sunscreen is its no white-residue formula. Unlike many other sunscreens that leave a chalky finish, BLACK GIRL SUNSCREEN blends seamlessly into the skin, leaving no trace. This is particularly important for darker skin tones, ensuring that the sunscreen is invisible and natural-looking.Moisturizing Formula:The lotion is highly moisturizing, thanks to ingredients like avocado, jojoba, cacao, carrot juice, and sunflower oil. It hydrates the skin effectively, leaving it soft and supple. This dual function of moisturizing and sun protection is a major plus.Non-Greasy and Lightweight:Despite its rich moisturizing properties, the sunscreen is lightweight and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any oily residue, making it comfortable to wear throughout the day. It also works well under makeup, acting as a smooth base.Skin-Friendly Ingredients:The product is free from harmful chemicals like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which are known to cause skin irritation and environmental damage. It's a great choice for those with sensitive skin and for those who prefer eco-friendly options.Pros:- SPF 30 provides reliable sun protection- No white residue, ideal for melanin-rich skin- Moisturizes effectively with natural ingredients- Lightweight and non-greasy formula- Free from harmful chemicalsConclusion:BLACK GIRL SUNSCREEN Face & Body Moisturizing Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 is an outstanding product that addresses the unique needs of melanin-rich skin. Its no white-residue formula, effective sun protection, and moisturizing properties make it a must-have for anyone looking to protect their skin without compromising on comfort or appearance. While it might be slightly more expensive, the quality and benefits justify the price. Highly recommended!"
"love this sunscreen! wish they made it in a bigger size but it's a perfect travel size. this product is amazing and makes skin not only glow, but also extremely soft! no white cast. i have very sensitive skin and it's fragrance free and doesn't irritate my skin or eyes at all!"
Great sunscreen dont have any white flakes or built up.
"I am a black man and I use this product to prevent early aging and protect my sensitive skin and it does great at it, it is lightweight and invisible. Great for any person of color or anyone who struggles with white cast with other sunscreens."
"I purchased this sunscreen based on the recommendations of Wirecutter. I have to say that it was exactly the right thing for my summer trip. The small size did not overfill my toiletries case, and I used it on sunny days for hiking and kayaking. I was pleased that the sunscreen did not feel oily on my face and that it absorbed into my skin easily. (I used in on my face more than anything else, not on my entire body.) It was more expensive than I wanted to pay, but I was very pleased with the way it worked and the compact size of the container. I highly recommend it!"
It’s smaller than I expected but I love how it feels on my skin after using it. It doesn’t leave white marks on my skin.
"I’ve been using Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Spray SPF 50 for a while now, and it has become my go-to sunscreen for all outdoor activities. Whether I’m hiking, running, or spending a day at the beach, this sunscreen provides excellent protection without feeling heavy or greasy.The spray application is incredibly convenient and ensures even coverage, which is perfect for those hard-to-reach areas. I appreciate that it’s water-resistant and sweat-proof, so I don’t have to worry about reapplying constantly, even during intense workouts.One of the best features is that it doesn’t leave a white residue on my skin, which is a common issue with other sunscreens. It absorbs quickly and doesn’t clog my pores, making it suitable for both my face and body.Overall, Coppertone Sport Sunscreen Spray SPF 50 is a reliable and effective sunscreen that I highly recommend to anyone with an active lifestyle. It’s a must-have in my outdoor gear!"
"I gave these to my kids to use at summer day camp.  They still burned, but I'm pretty sure that is partly their fault.  Did they apply often enough?  Likely not.  Did they apply all over their body, ESPECIALLY THEIR FACES LIKE I KEEP TELLING THEM?!  Likely not.  Did the highschool (at best) aged counselors who said they'd help apply sunscreen actually do their job?  Likely not.It worked when I applied it.  5 Stars."
"These sprays are usable on face and body so that makes life easier, very pleased, price was great and it is important to take care of your skin"
Couldn’t beat the price and lasted for two weeks in the sun at the beach.
I love this suntan lotion. I love the spray option and it actually lasts a long time for a bottle. I just finished up last summers and bought a three pack again.
Always great quality!  Recommend.
"Me encanta esta marca he usado otras y definitivamente me quedo con esa, para la exposición al sol protege muchísimo la uso más que todo para la playa."
Best kind for the pool
"I first used Coppertone whilst on holiday in Florida. From the 1st use it was brilliant. In fact, the only downside to using it is that it may stain your towels if they're white and you reapply a few times a day if you're as OCD as I am. But this is, without doubt, THE best 50 SPF I've ever used. Never burned, tanned brilliantly and total peace of mind. Pricey but well worth it."
"Habe dieses Sonnenspray in Florida erstmals gekauft, hat mich völlig überzeugt. Der Witz ist nur , dass der Hersteller Bayer Leverkusen ist, in Deuschland das Spray aber nicht erhältlich ist. So muss ich jedesmal in den USA bestellen mit entsprechenden Versandkosten🙄"
"Wir benützen diese Sonnencreme seit einigen Jahren und sie ist für uns das beste Produkt auf dem Markt. Leicht aufzutragen und 100 % Schutz vor Sonnenbrand, an Land und im Wasser. Zudem bietet die Firma  TOY WORLD GROUP einen hervorragenden, zuverlässigen Kundenservice und sendet diese Sonnencreme problemlos nach Deutschland. Auch das Ablaufdatum war kein Problem, wie in anderen Bewertungen bemängelt.  Im Oktober 2023 bekommen und der Ablauf ist erst in zwei Jahren 10/2025"
"This stuff is excellent. I'm a type 1/2 skin, easy burner and I have never burned using this. Easy to apply, smell gorgeous and at just over £8.50 a can (and free next day delivery) its excellent value as well!!"
i have to wear this all year around and smells great and easy to apply
"I know this product is meant to be used as a facial sunscreen. However, due to its 3 ounce size, I keep it in my backpack to use as a touchup for my body. I already have a dedicated face sunscreen. I chose this product because it’s oil and fragrance free. There’s a slight chemical smell from the ingredients. A little goes along way.  The consistency is thick but after you rub it in, it blends nicely to my skin and I hardly notice it’s there."
"I have used this product in the past and consistently like it. I don’t get out in the sun as much as I used to, but when I do, I make sure that I put this on before I do my make up.. Very, very happy with the product no breakouts no problems. That’s the way it should go. Thank you."
"So lightweight, invisible, pleasantThere are better sunscreens like mineral oil ones (Prequel brand is great) that have skin benefits but in terms of feel, this is about as good"
"I decided to buy this sunscreen as the last one I bought left a white cast on my face and read reviews this does not. I am glad to say, this sunscreen does not leave a white cast! I've been using it for a while and have to say I mostly like the sunscreen.Pros: It does not leave a cast, it has pretty good coverage. I would say it's on the slightly thicker side. Doesn't make me shiny.Cons: It pills if you don't move fast enough. Maybe I'm not waiting long enough after putting on moisturizer, but if I don't spread the stuff fast or evenly enough, I'm stuck brushing little sunscreen balls off my face. It ever so slightly stings my face, but I have drier sensitive skin.I see a lot of comments say it layers well under make-up. I don't really wear any, but I do notice the sunscreen isn't obvious throughout the day."
"I’m really happy to find a face sunscreen that does not leave your face an oily mess! This Nutrogena oil-free sunscreen leaves your face with a matte finish and protects your face very well from harmful sunrays. I have had some mild eye irritation, but not as bad as other sunscreens I have used. Makeup also applies very well over this sunscreen. Honestly, this sunscreen has been a game changer as I’ve tried many different sunscreens and have been disappointed. I highly recommend this oil-free face sunscreen!"
"I have high allergy skin and prone to acnes, so I never use sunscreen (Unless I'm at the beach), but this is sunscreen I use every day before I put on makeup.  I wish I find this 10 years ago."
I am fully melanated and this product spreads evenly on my skin. I also have oily skin and it works perfectly for me.
"I have been using this moisturizer for about 2 years now it works well in protecting my skin from sundamage and it's not too oily, it's just right"
"Me encanto este protector solar, mantiene tu carita suave 💘"
"Adoro questa crema, la sua consistenza, il fatto che mi protegge dalle radiazioni...Ne metto giusto un po' ogni mattina dopo aver lavato la faccia, sia d'estate che d'inverno, e mi fa sentire SICURA e pulita tutto il giorno!Dopo l'utilizzo, la mia pelle risulta compatta, MAI lucida e mai GRASSA!E' diventata la mia base trucco preferita ♥"
Very good product. I will buy it again
"Das ist die erste Sonnencreme, die ich täglich im Gesicht nutzen kann. Ich neige sehr zu fettiger Haut und Akne. Seit ich diese Sonnencreme benutze ist meine Haut sogar noch besser geworden. Kann sie nur empfehlen."
Products are good
Australian sunscreens are the most rigorously tested so their efficacy is dependable. Yes all mineral sunscreens leave somewhat of a cast unless they’re tinted but the texture in this one is very thin and easily spread. It leaves a moisturized finish BUT it’s not sticky or heavy feeling. It doesn’t even get caught around the roots of my facial hair which is a huge issue for most spf. The white cast lessens as it sets in the skin. This is the spf I wear when I’m home and don’t care about the mineral cast or sheen. Chemical spf can be irritating to use on a daily basis. It’s very easy to apply and comfortable which is what’s most important. It’s also economical!
"This is my favorite mineral sunscreen. My only complaint is it is runny enough that it comes out very fast and can make a mess easily. That being said, I wouldn't change it because I think that is part of the reason it rubs in so quickly and smoothly. It tends to not leave any whiteness on skin."
"Blue Lizard is great, but I'd recommend ordering it in a bottle or can over these squeeze tubes. Amazon ships it in paper envelopes, and the tubes get smashed, leading to an envelope full of uncontained sunscreen. If you can't find the tubes locally, I recommend ordering the bottle instead, versus playing sunscreen roulette with a squeeze tube and hoping it arrives intact"
"I am using this sunscreen exclusively during my pregnancy because I believe it is the safest option without harmful chemicals found in most others (and it’s also reef safe). It works well and has protected me from sunburn. Although the white film is a little annoying, it’s something I don’t mind dealing with considering the safety aspect.I originally bought the wider bottles (the hard bottle) and they were perfect. For our babymoon, I decided to switch to the thinner squeeze bottles because I thought they may pack better - BIG MISTAKE! The bottles/lids do not do their job of keeping the lotion inside. They leaked sunscreen over our clothes, and once inside a bag with other sunscreens, continued to leak all over the other bottles. They also would just leak sunscreen as I had the bottle open, I’d leave a trail of the liquid on the ground. This has happened with numerous bottles (I bought 3) and was not a one-time faulty cap/lid.I would recommend this sunscreen, especially to pregnant women, but don’t get the squeeze bottle!"
My young son has very sensitive skin and we have tried so many different sunscreens with no luck. Until NOW! This is so great for sensitive skin and it doesn't leave his face all white. It also lasts a long time even in water. I'm very happy with this find.
"Once we realized how toxic regular sunscreen is, we needed to make a change. Now we know to go with mineral sunscreen. It does go on white but you can rub it in and you won't be white. They do make a spray version.  It is pricey-er than normal sunscreen."
It is a CLEAN brand and works very well. We have used all summer long for my 3 year old and I have no complaints at all
"Worked on Vac in PR, where sun is intense...kept me from burning!  Would recommend for sensitive skin people."
"I have tried ALL the SPF! This is the BEST under makeup.  It REALLY does not feel thick, greasy, or leave a white cast at all.  Buy it, you will NOT regret it! PS> I have never bothered to write a review but felt this was well worth it."
"I love this sunscreen so much. We all know by now that Korean sunscreen is far superior to American sunscreen in terms of preventing sun damage. I like this formula in particular because I have really dry skin that's easily irritated. This product feels like a hydrating skin treatment. It leaves my skin very dewy, and there's no white cast. To be honest, I don't spend a ton of time in the sun, so I haven't put it to the test to see if I burn or freckle with it on. I wish they sold it in larger sizes to make it more sustainable."
Works great and will not feel heavy and greasy. You will love it and you will actually use it because it doesn't feel yucky on your skin.
"No whitecast, moisturized but not greasy feel... this stuff rocks! This is my second time buying it. Doesn't break me out."
"I normally HATE using sunscreen since it irritates my eyes and makes me look like a garlic knot. I also have very oily skin, so I've never liked anything greasy-looking on my face. But this sunscreen is honestly very nice to have on the skin. It adds a healthy glow and DOES NOT have a white caste which is amazing since most sunscreens do. It does not feel greasy and it doesn't irritate my eyes, which is good because I can apply it without breaking out in tears lol. I use it under makeup as well and it doesn't interfere with the application whatsoever.I do wish the bottle was bigger, but if you use it appropriately, you should have a good amount left to last you a while. Other than that, it's a great sunscreen and I highly recommend using this!"
I bought this because a dermatologist recommended it on a video on Instagram.  I'm in my 40s and I still breakout from sunscreen.  This stuff is great and I didn't breakout all summer. Highly recommend.
"This sunscreen is pretty greasy so probably not great for oily skin, but it’s the only sunscreen that moisturizes my very dry skin! It’s one of the only sunscreens I’ve used that don’t pill and it goes smoothly under my makeup. If you wear makeup underneath it just make sure to use a good setting spray so it doesn’t melt if you sweat. Will keep purchasing!"
"Don’t go too close to eyes, it will make them water."
Both my son and my self use it while in vacation we tanned crazy on our face!
I love this brand because they are reef friendly and do a great job of sun protection. I use level 50 and don’t burn but turn nice and brown. I love the small size as they fit into our clear bag for traveling with carry on luggage.
"I really enjoyed using this SPF. It has a wonderful tropical smell, almost like fruity bananas and coconut. I do prefer mineral sunscreen, so I’m hoping that they come out with one similar to this. This SPF lasted me pretty long and kept me protected for a long time out in the sun, even wile sweating or getting wet. Great product overall!"
Great sunscreen expensive but I have never burned when I have used it!
"Used over the summer in Washington state, Arizona and Panama. Whole family likes this one."
I put it on I don’t burn
"Like all Sun Bum products, this is high quality. I use a large amount to cover all exposed areas and it keeps me protected all day long. I recommend this sunscreen for good absorption, light feel and level of protection."
"Took this product island hopping in SE Asia where there wasn’t shade to be found much.  I am a pale white guy, and came home with no sunburn at all.  Smells like coconut didn’t break me out and was reef safe.  I recommend."
Works great with out the dangerous chemicals.  I buy a 15 and a 30 strength every year.
"Muy buen protector, la textura es buena y agradable. Funciona bien en pieles delicadas."
Excellent product
Doesn't sting on application to skin
"Un súper producto, soy alérgico al sol y viaje a Cancún y sin ningún problema."
"This sunscreen is for whole body. Surprisedly, it makes my skin looked glow and moisturized. And it seems to be absorbed quickly, and SPF 60 put my heart to tummy, loved it. Just a reminder, use it when lying on the beach, not swimming/snorkeling at sea to product coral reefs :)"
"I can't express how much Aveeno sunscreen has become a vital part of my daily routine. From the moment I started using it, I felt a genuine sense of relief and care for my skin. Its gentle, nourishing formula doesn't just protect me from the sun; it makes my skin feel loved and pampered. The lightweight, non-greasy texture ensures that I stay comfortable and confident throughout the day. Aveeno has truly transformed my skincare routine, and I am deeply grateful for its soothing touch and reliable protection. It’s more than just sunscreen—it's a little moment of self-care that I cherish every day.I hope my review really help you ."
I like this product for daily use as a facial sunscreen. It is a good product that is odorless and goes on smoothly and evenly.
This is the best face sunscreen/moisturizer combination I have tried. It provides sun protection yet is very light and not oily.
This is the only facial SPF which doesn't cause allergies for me and which doesn't leave a white cover on my face making me look like a Geisha like several other facial SPF's did (even Clinique and Estée Lauder).I wonder why neither CVS nor Walgreen's sell this?Every year I have to order it online again.
"I'm very impressed with Aveeno's 60 SPF sunscreen. It has a delightful fragrance and a non-greasy formula that absorbs quickly, leaving no residue. I live in an always sunny city, so it gives me an excellent protection without the typical sunscreen feel, making it perfect for everyday use. Highly recommended for its effective and pleasant application!"
"I’ve been looking for a sunscreen that I can wear daily without feeling sticky and greasy. And boy does this fit the bill! I’m very impressed with how little this feels like traditional sunscreen, it feels just like I’ve put a normal lotion on! It’s not greasy, has no white cast, and goes on very easy. I will definitely be buying the bigger bottle of this when I run out. There is a slight fragrance but it is pleasant."
"I usually love anything Aveeno.. I use their lotion, face wash.. and I was excited for this sunscreen. It does absorb into your skin and dry quickly. There’s absolutely no greasy feel to it. BUT.. the fragrance!! Keep in mind that scent is very personal and this one is not for me. It’s too strong and it lingers. Fortunately someone else in my household loves it and is using it. Aveeno.. please make a fragrance free version of this sunscreen.. I love everything about it, except for the fragrance… thus, the 3 stars"
I received item damaged
"This product is 4 months away from expiry which they don’t say while selling. The cream and oil separate no matter how you keep it or how much u shake. I still used it 2 times & my face got extremely oily and icky. If you like this product, I suggest buy it elsewhere where they stock it properly & is a new batch.I am a big fan of Aveeno products which I find suit most sensitive skins. Not this one. Avoid!"
"This is my favorite sunscreen of all time because it feels light while you are applying it and dries down fast without giving you that sticky feeling that so many sunscreens have. It feels moisturizing without feeling heavy. The scent is light and does not linger.  I like that it's an SPF 50. I never burn when I'm wearing this sunscreen all day, but if I forget to reapply it, I will tan but not burn. However, you should definitely reapply because tanning just ages the skin. The price was great for a two pack. I do wish Amazon offered this sunscreen as a single tube though. Sometimes, I only need one tube, like now when it's getting close to the end of summer."
Can’t believe how comfortable and lightweight this sunscreen is. It is hard to find in stores so I came online to repurchase after not being able to find. I use it on myself and my child- no grease and no sharp sunscreen smell. We will be wearing it daily into the winter months as well.
"Blends in quickly.Nice scent that is subtle and does fade.Doesn't sting my eyes.Plays well under makeup.I haven't burned when wearing it.NOTE: They make a version of this SPF marketed as the facial version. IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME. Check the ingredients! Save yourself the money and buy the ""body"" version for all over (including face) use!"
"This product is the best for your face but can be used anywhere. It’s non greasy, light, pleasant smelling and has great SPF power!"
"I’ve always hated wearing sunscreen.  Probably some traumatic childhood experience of being slathered in oily goo at the beach.  Alas, I’m fair-skinned and forced to wear it if I’m going to spend any appreciable amount of time outdoors.  I’d been buying whatever was on sale at the supermarket (dreading the moment I’d apply it), and decided to see if there was something markedly better.  I picked up this Banana Boat “Light as Air” sunscreen along with 3 others marketed as “sheer” facial sunscreen to try out.This stuff is a HUGE improvement over the giant bottles of goop we all grew up with.  A pea-sized drop is enough to cover my face- forehead to chin and ear to ear.  It’s absorbs fairly quickly and doesn’t leave your hands feeling like you need to wash them with a degreaser.  By the time I leave the house my face feels pretty normal to the touch; my glasses aren’t slip-sliding off my face and I don’t slime everything that touches my face.My main complaint is the smell.  It has a distinct scent like piña-colada’s.  Mucho beach vibes, but a bit weird for daily wear- to the office or if you’re using toiletries with other scents (like deodorant, after-shave, perfume/cologne, etc.).  I’ll keep it with my beach/camping/travel stuff, but use one of the sunscreens I found around town."
I love this sunscreen!!  It is easy to apply and is not sticky or goopy and does not smell. The lotion/cream glides on and does not glump.  It turns clear so no sunscreen stripes.  I am fair skinned and after a week at the beach and I have only a touch of color (no burn)!  Even the grandkids have no complaints.  I will not go back to the other sunscreens
I liked this very much at the pool. It worked well. I got a very light tan but did not burn. I probably reapplied more than recommended.
"If you are like me, then you have been searching far and wide for a sunscreen that doesn’t want to make you claw your skin off. Well, I finally found it. This is truly lightweight, doesn’t have a heavy scent (still scented, just very lightly), and not greasy!! Once you rub it in you don’t even know you have it on. It doesn’t leave that gross feeling on your hands, your arms and legs aren’t shinny and overall you just don’t feel gross.Whoever’s idea this was, and whoever created the formula are truly amazing people. I hope this product never leaves!"
Ugh. This sunscreen smells absolutely disgusting.... fake pineapple fruity bleh!!! Avoid if you have any sense of smell at all.
"I have very sensitive eyes and I also sweat a lot (hyperhidrosis). This means that someway or another a bit of sunscreen tends to get in my eyes while I'm going about my daily activities. This sunscreen does not cause irritation to my eyes or my skin at all. It does leave a white cast if too much product is used or if it is blended out properly, but that is a negligible drawback for me because this thing makes my skin look porcelain.This is the clearest that my skin has ever been EVER! When people ask me what's the secret I tell them it's literally just sunscreen and adequate hydration.All of my dark marks and hyperpigmentation are gone. My face has even gotten a little lighter since using this.I've been using this for almost 2 years now and there's no going back for me. This is my holy grail sunscreen."
"I have been using this sunscreen and different variants of it for 4 years, and I love it! My skin is sometimes oily, sometimes dry, but this sunscreen is perfect either way. On oily skin, it does not leave it shiny, and on dry skin, it actually makes it feel more moisturized. I have worn this sunscreen EVERY SINGLE DAY and it has never caused any irritation, redness, or pimples. I have a few other products that I use in my skincare routine, and this is lightweight enough that it is not too much for my skin and does not clog my pores. Yes, this sunscreen is pricy, but one bottle of it lasts me months and, like mentioned, I use it every single day. That being said, I only use it for my face and neck, so a little goes a long way. Highly highly recommend this product."
"I like this product because it blends into the skin well and has a longer - 80 minute - performance than some products. However, I found it has a component that has been deemed not to be reef safe (most of my swimming is in a pool so not a big issue), but for buyers who think they might want to use this on the beach, it may not be appropriate."

I’ve been using EltaMD sunscreen for over four years, and last year I purchased the Sport version in a larger format since I work out outside every morning. It’s excellent for outdoor activities and daily use.It’s also Broad Spectrum, which protects skin against many kinds of light, including blue light from electronic devices.This brand was recommended by my dermatologist, and to this day, she still includes it in my skincare routine.I bought the 7oz bottle, and after applying it TWICE a day, it lasted around one year and two months! Now, they’ve upgraded the package to 8oz without changing the price. I just reordered.EltaMD only uses two powerful ingredients that don’t clog pores or damage the skin barrier.I love it and will continue to buy it!"
Is the best on the world
"I used this sunscreen from last summer through this spring to play pickleball or go to hiking.  I liked it since it didn’t get sticky and people said it smelled good.  It worked well and the bottle with a pump lasted for a long time.  The reason I gave 4 stars not 5 stars is because the new sunscreen I ordered earlier this summer came in a tube, not a bottle with a pump.  Since the sunscreen is pretty thick, it’s hard to push sunscreen out of the  tube.  It’s a pretty big tube.  I don’t know why they changed the packaging., but I don’t really like the tube, and I wish they kept the old bottle with a pump."
This was originally recommended by my Dermatologist.  I love that it is tinted and applies very easily.  Not greasy.
"This goes on easily, is not greasy, and doesn't sting your eyes if you sweat. No yucky odors. Really the best sunscreen I have used and worth the money."
"Me lo recomendó una Dermatóloga y lo he usado durante 12 años, con color y sin color.  Es muy bueno, no es grasoso, no deja la piel extremadamente brillosa, pero tampoco la deja reseca..  Funciona muy bien contra el Sol y le cae muy bien a mi piel.  Lo seguiré comprando y recomendando."

Very excllnt product with impressiveresult
Fantastisch product sneert lekker en plakt niet.
Best mineral sunscreen I've ever had. Every time I try a different one I always go back to this one.
This sunblock is amazing! It provides excellent protection for my face without feeling greasy or heavy. I love how it keeps my skin safe from the sun while feeling lightweight and breathable. Perfect for daily use!
Me encanta porque no es grasosa para mi cutis que ya es por si grasoso. Me va a la perfección.Me lo recetó mi dermatóloga.
I went crazy trying a lot of sunscreens because they all make me breakout. I have very fair skin and like to walk a lot. This sunscreen works well. It does leave a slight white color but it looks ok and evens out skin. No breakouts with this product. I will stick with it.
I started using this sunscreen several years ago on a recommendation from my dermatologist. I tan very easily and I use this daily to protect  my face from sun exposure. It works great. I can totally see the difference in tan compared to the rest of my body. It goes on light and feels like a normal moisturizer. No heavy greasy film at all. Highly recommend it if you want to avoid looking old regardless of your age!
"Overall, this sunscreen is great. It’s not as thick as I had hoped, but that’s fine given the other benefits: light, doesn’t leave any white residue, easy to apply, barely feels like you’re wearing sunscreen. I will buy this again."
I love how silky smooth this applies and works as a nice primer for your makeup as well. Without makeup I think it leaves a nice moisturized look too. Highly recommend!
"My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen. It goes on really smoothly and it is ultra thin so its very easy to work into your skin. Remember to shake it before you apply. Be careful, because when you tilt it a lot of product comes out due to how thin it is.I do not feel this sunscreen on my face which is something that no other sunscreens have offered that I've tried including the cream version of this product. It leaves a slight white matte cast but it's not as bad as other sunscreens. I'm very fair skinned and have rosacea so that is actually pretty helpful for me as it reduces the appearance of my redness.I don't find that I have to reapply throughout the day even though that is what is recommended. My face does get a little oily during the day and I have to use face blotting sheets to absorb the oil a few hours later. Make sure not to put on your eyes or it will burn a few hours later.This is my number one sunscreen. Highly recommend. Don't even waste your time trying anything else."
Goes on very smooth and dries with no shine or stickiness. Minimum smell. Makes my skin feel very soft and even gives a blurring effect.
This is a good feel sunscreen. But since they are not posting my last review I'm doubting if it is real or fake since that is the concern I had raised in my last review.Will buy again when I see evidence of authenticity... certificates.. reseller authorisation.. something.. else I'm sticking to isdin from nykaa
"Diese Sonnenschutz ist sehr angenehm zum Tragen. Es es hinterlässt so etwas wie einen puderartigen Film auf meinem Gesicht. Ich habe richtige lange eine richtigen Sonnenschutz Creme für meinen Haut gesucht, der den Haut nicht verdunkelt. Nach einem Tiefen-Tauchen im Internet, entscheidete ich für die und bin sehr ,sehr zufrieden. Ich kann über die Creme schminken, ohne Streifen und stapfen zu bekommen. Ehrlich gesagt, die Creme ist als Primer tätig. Diese hier ist ab jetzt meine Suncream of Choice.Große Empfehlung 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🤳"
"This product is AMAZING!I suffer from hyper pigmentation (melasma) and was recommended this product by a doctor. I wear it everyday as a base for my makeup. It has a light milky texture that the skin absorbs and within 30 seconds you can apply makeup. Not heavy, not oily or greasy and is easy to apply. An apsolute must for anyone who cares about their skin. I love this! Usually I use the exact same in a 50 but risked the 60 and it's just ideal. I won't go out without it on!"
"Outside of india you can get La Roche Posay products so easily and they are very affordable. Unfortunately in india buying them has become very expensive and it seems like a luxury skincare when it’s not. So whenever you find good deals on amazon, buy it!"
I love this sun screen.It feel very light on the face and it is very god for my dark spots. I can recommend it.
"I love the fact that this sunscreen comes in a massive jug, which makes it super convenient for regular use! The smell is tolerable, which is a plus since some sunscreens can be overwhelming. I typically pump this sunscreen into a smaller 1.7oz vacuum pump for everyday use and travel, making it easy to carry around without taking up too much space. While it does leave a slightly greasy finish, I find it manageable, especially since I have oily skin. Despite the finish, I appreciate the protection it offers, and the large size means I won’t run out anytime soon. Overall, it's a solid choice for those who need sunscreen in bulk!"
"I've had to wear sunscreen for years now - due to this weird reaction my skin has to the sun (polymorphous light eruption) and putting on sunscreen every day has not always been my favorite thing. I've used dozens of brands in the past, with varying degrees of success, but I've noticed this one stands out for me the most in that by the end of the day my face is not red, hot, my ears don't have a burning sensation the way previous sunscreens left me by the end of the day) - which to be fair, I don't reapply every two hours because that's too much work.However... I've been so pleased with it, it's a little greasy / gross at first but it rubs in and after 2-3 hours, I don't really notice that it's on my face / body. PLUS... I don't smell like a beach anymore. It's nice to not hug people and they be like ""why do you smell like you're going to the beach or a pool"" LOL. It's a little expensive, but for me (with my specific condition) it's nice not to have little bumps on my face or body from the sun because the protection lasts all day (even though technically you're supposed to reapply it every 2 hours). I put it on my face, and I have sensitive skin - but zero issues with it clogging my pores or giving me any issues. I haven't had a single pimple or blackhead since using it. And I sweat and hit the gym 5X a week and no issues whatsoever.Highly recommend :)"
"I’ve been using the Supergoop! PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50 for a while now, and it has quickly become my go-to sunscreen for both face and body. As someone with a busy lifestyle—balancing my roles as a teacher, professional singer, and bilingual voiceover actress—finding a sunscreen that offers reliable protection without feeling heavy or greasy is essential.This lotion is everything I could ask for in a sunscreen. It’s lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving no white cast, which is a huge plus, especially when I’m on the go. It feels moisturizing without being oily, and it layers perfectly under makeup or on its own. I also appreciate that it’s water-resistant, making it ideal for outdoor activities or those hot, sunny days when I’m out and about.The broad-spectrum protection gives me peace of mind, knowing I’m shielded from both UVA and UVB rays. Plus, the formula is gentle enough for my face and strong enough for the rest of my body, so I don’t need to use separate products.Overall, the Supergoop! PLAY Everyday Lotion has become an essential part of my daily routine. It’s a fantastic all-in-one solution that I highly recommend to anyone looking for effective, everyday sun protection."
This sunscreen is so lightweight and it doesn’t give off that thick film or over coconut smell that some of the other sunscreens may give off this is absolutely my favorite sunscreen!
"I have become a sunblock realist. I used to use predominantly zinc sunblocks that are white as hell and hard to rub in and that make sunblocking kids more of a chore than it already is, so if you are going for a sunblock that you’ll use vs. the best “safest” ingredients, maybe this review is for you. Supergoop smells good, protects well, rubs in easily and has pretty good chemical ingredients. But it’s expensive! I also like the equate one that’s a fraction of the price. But this one smells better and has somewhat “better” ingredients (although equate is very similar and you can get it online vs Walmart maybe not).  I probably won’t repurchase because of the price but if money weren’t an issue I’d buy this every summer."
"My favorite sunblock of all time. I'm autistic and I get easily over stimulated. However, this sun block lacks that greasy film feel that most give. This sunblock changed my life!"
It goes on like a clear soothing lotion. It smells nice. Very subtle. I like the small size for my tennis bag and travel. 👍
This sunscreen should be the benchmark for all sunscreens. Easy to apply rubs in with no white cast smells good not over powering and protects skin from the sun. Love this stuff! I do wish you could lock the pump though it’s a pain to travel with this stuff when you go to higher altitudes because it expands and product comes out
I’m brown skin and it protects my skin soo well. I want a bigger size… but hard to find on Amazon
"This product is brilliant. No white cast, non-greasy. Only problem is you cannot justify that price at all. So many Korean products are just as good for 1/4 of the price.I've read so many people who've said they love this product but it's way too expensive. Had they reduced the prize reasonably, they'd probably end up making more money than marketing it at £40 for a feather's worth. Make it make sense."
"Disappointing, whilst it doesn’t leave a white cast, it does leave a shine similar to Vaseline, and stays a bit sticky."
"I’ve been through so many different brands and types of sunscreen through the years and this is the one I like the best, so much so, I have it on subscribe and save, I’ve never had a sunburn with it, it goes on smoothly and evenly, it has a pleasant smell, it soaks in well and is waterproof, it lasts well and I get a lot of applications from one bottle."
I love this brand and also the shimmer it leaves on my body. It also protects well.
"This is a nice smelling, non-greasy sunscreen that works well for me"
I spend hours in the sun every summer at the lake and I did not burn at all this year. This was my go to sunscreen.
"We go to the beach a lot and this is my favorite sunblock to use. With 3 daughters, I make sure we apply throughout the day to protect our skin so I love that it’s in a 2-pack. And it smells like Hawaii!!!"
Spray is good goes on nicely..More expensive then other sunscreen sprayers…
"I am a huge fan of sunblock because I spend a lot of time in the sun. I apply it when I wake in the morning so I don't forget before going outside and I reapply when I'll be outside for extended periods of time.  One issue I continually have is that my skin looks greasy after application.  I had a friend mention that my sunblock reminded her that she forgot to apply because she could see the oil on my skin.  Thus, I tried this.  I love it.  I have no issue with feeling greasy and it works perfectly.  One of my kids hates wearing sunblock since it leaves a residue but I'm going to have him try this one.  I'm sure he will be happy with the results."
Smells great!
"I like this sunscreen for whenever I need more than a facial SPF 30 like when I know I will be outdoors or next to a sunny window for several hours. I’ve previously had issues with certain hybrid and organic sunscreens when it comes to irritation around my eyes. This inorganic sunscreen, I’ve literally put on my eyelids and under the eyes, walked outside in humid 90+ degree weather, reapplied after 1.5-2 hours, and have not felt my eyes stinging at all. The only very minor downside is that as a person with light/medium tan skin, I have to rub it in longer than other types of sunscreens to get rid of the white cast but it does go away. I’ve put it over light make up, previously set with setting spray, and it doesn’t seem to ruin it, which probably speaks more volumes about the setting spray but I digress. Regardless, highly recommend and worth trying for anyone with eye sensitivity from other sunscreens"
"Goes on smooth, doesn't leave your face white."
"This is a decent choice for a facial sunscreen. The formula does cause stinging to the eyes, even when applied to the eyelid and during sweating/swimming. There is a slight white cast, but not as bad as some products. I would say that for a facial sunscreen, this feels like it could have been formulated a bit better as far as how heavy it feels on the skin. It's not the worst I've tried, but there are formulas with a bit better skin feel for the face out there. I'll use the whole bottle for sure, and it works just fine, but I'm not sure if I'd buy again."
"I found a sample at the dermatologist’s office where my spouse had an appointment.  I liked it so well, I bought bottles for both my spouse and myself. It’s good for light skin or for dark skin. Even if you apply it over other cream, it doesn’t burden your skin. I wear it close to my eyes and haven’t had a problem with it stinging, but my husband who slathers it on, reports that he has to keep it away from his eyes or it will sting. I am bringing a sample to my brother who needs protection and hasn’t found anything he can tolerate."
"My favorite mineral face sunscreen! I have tried them all from the far too expensive dermatologist brands to the cheaper drugstore brands and this one beats them all. Rubs in well, no white cast and goes perfectly under makeup. Highly recommend."
very good sun protector. its very liquidy but I like it. does not smell like anything. No allergic reactions and it didnt break me out. It's a great inexpensive sunblock.
Truly a sunscreen for sensitive skin - and it works.
I have not breakout but it leaves whitecast
"Es mi segundo bote pedido, es el mejor protector solar mineral que he probado. No es graso, es fluido y no comedogénico. Hay que agitarlo muy bien, no deja blanco pero sí te aclara un tono después de la segunda re-aplicación, siento que no se me ve mucho porque soy apiñonada en pieles pálidas no creo que se note pero en pieles más morenas es algo que deben considerar. Yo soy piel normal sensible con rosácea y me ha costado encontrar protectores solares que no me irriten, me quedaré con este sin duda un buen tiempo, espero que lo sigan vendiendo. 💖"
جيد
"Deja algo de acabado blanco pero, tiene un toque seco y se absorbe rápido por lo tanto no es incómodo y se ajusta rápido al maquillaje, lo volvería a comprar"
"Me dejé guiar por los comentarios que decían no dejaba la cara tan blanca, pero qué engaño! Me dejó BLANCA y no de difumina, no lo compren."
"Don’t think that it’s spf 50 (based on a video I saw online & personal experience). I’ve got new hyperpigmentation upon wearing this sunscreen and it has a pretty obvious white cast (2.5/5).Came in a big bag although it’s just a small product, very redundant and not good for the environment."
I have sensitive skin and I can use this sunscreen with no issues and I am fair skinned and I have never burned as long as I keep reapplying as directed! I love that its not think or oily and it does not leave a white film on me!
"After a day in the sun I don't get burned! However, I can see very clear differences between the areas where I applied it really well, and the places i didn't. So i know its doing its job when applied correctly.Added bonus, the State of Hawaii has it on their list of approved sun blocks that are non-damaging to Eco-systems.It can change in appearance and will start to look a bit like cottage cheese, just shake it up really well to return it to its original texture. It absolutely still works."
It's vegan and reef friendly and I like buying products that help the environment when available.
"It works good. The banana smell is soft and nice. It don't feel oily or sticky, and leave a very fresh sensation, it's like you don't have anything."
Works all day even after swimming!
"Like many people, I don't like greasier suntan lotions. I rarely swim and don't often lay out in the sun; if I'm putting on suntan lotion it's generally because I'm hiking, walking, working, or maybe fishing. This means I'm moving quite a bit and wearing equipment or clothing, and in both cases greasier lotions tend to make their presence known. As such, I prefer something which isn't so oily.First, I tried Skin Aqua, a Japanese suntan lotion. I mostly used the gold variety, and found that to be pretty close to perfect, you can hardly tell that you are wearing it after 10m or so. The non-gold version is also pretty good, but slightly oilier. However, both did seem not to last quite as long as other suntan lotions I've tried, even if they did well enough. They are pretty expensive, so maybe I was being too conservative with the quantity of lotion used.Sun Bum is a great deal, and I heard it wasn't too greasy, so I decided to try it. It is true that it's much better than most lotions I've tried, with the exception of some spray-on varieties which are specifically marketed as being dry. It was also completely effective, stopping me from getting any sorts of burns whatsoever. It has a strong, but not overpowering, traditional suntan lotion smell to it. It does burn if it gets into your eyes on account of heavy sweating, but I think all lotions are like that.Basically, while I'd recommend trying Skin Aqua first, this is strong second place."
"This sunscreen is a favorite that's specifically requested by my whole family. It goes on smooth and rubs in quickly. It says reef friendly, but on a recent trip to Kona our snorkel trip guide that it was not on the approved list. Regardless, we will continue to use it when not in Kona."
Love this brand great coverage and you don’t burn
"Huele delicioso. no se siente demasiado cremoso y se absorbe rápido. Vivo en playa así que el cuidado para arrecifes es vital. No deja grasosa la piel pero sí tiene textura, tampoco se ve cuando sudas. Yo lo uso exclusivamente para el cuerpo y lo recomiendo siempre. El mejor bloqueador que he probado hasta ahora."
"This smells so good!  It goes on well, leaves no messy residue and soaks in to skin quickly.  Didn't get burnt once and it was HOT!  Great product, will be topping up my supplies soon  with this again."
"The texture is very rich, gives a dewy finish. Packagw size is just amazing for a whole family use. Highly recommended."
No protege mucho...
Die Sonnenmilch riecht so gut. Sie hat meine Haut im Hawaiiurlaub optimal geschützt und gepflegt.  Ich habe sie nun auch schon mehrfach gekauft
"Best I found so far, I've had the SPF-15 and the SPF-30, easy application, stays on after swimming, smells good, feels good. The soft continuous spray gets a nice even coat."
I love this so much and it makes me wear sunscreen because it enhances my skin and smells wonderful
"Why I need sunscreen and how I came upon Australian Gold:Living in Arizona, where the sun seems to shine 364 days a year, can be tough, especially after suffering with melasma after two pregnancies. My dermatologist insisted that daily sunscreen and sun hats were the key to to prevent the melasma from worsening. I initially fell in love with a pricey SPF 50 sunscreen oil from a brand with goop in its name, but its cost made daily use impractical. So, I went on a quest for a more affordable alternative. While specific high-SPF oils eluded me, I did find this Australian Gold bronzer gel.Why I love it and how I apply it:To my surprise, I found Australian Gold bronzer gel to be a product I genuinely enjoy using and have made a permanent part of my routine. It smells delightful, applies effortlessly, and leaves no greasy residue. If I am going to swim, I put the sunscreen on at least 20-30 minutes before to give it a chance to work before getting wet, then I liberally reapply at least once an hour. When following that routine, I’ve yet to experience any uncomfortable sunburns while using this.My picky husband who loathes sunscreen approves, too:My husband, who spends 95% of his time tending to his garden despises sunscreen because of its typical oily feel. One day, I handed him this gel when the regular lotion he uses was nowhere to be found. Now we go through twice as much because he refuses to use anything else.Sunmary:I have yet to find another product that is similar to this one, and it’s only downside is difficulty in finding the spf50 at a reasonable cost. However, spf 30 is affordable and easy to find so we’ve since switched to that to prevent spending 4x more for one bottle of the spf50.  (It might be that the spf 50 is low in stock and therefore the price is high until it’s restocked!)Tl;dr: this sunscreen rocks. The liquidy waterish gel  consistency leaves no greasy residue and smells delicious. Even my picky husband loves it too. If I’m going to be swimming, I apply 20-30 minutes before going in then reapply at least once in an hour and have yet to have any uncomfortable sunburns."
Good for sensitive skin.  Brings tan on and helps avoid burn.
Great purchase wish they had in 3 ounce siZe
Just got back from Cabo and used it every day at the pool and beach. This is worth the $$.
I had a friend turn me into this product. I wanted sun block but missed the bronze look from a tan. This product protects you from the sun but left me with a nice bronze look so I don't look ghostly ha ha
light feeling and gives a slight bronze glow as it states...
Su consistencia es especitaTiene olor suaveViene de buen tamaño
Excelente producto!! Lo uso hace años.
"No sirvió, no lo pude utilizar"
No lo he usado como bronceador aún solo como crema facial y corpora por tener factor de protección sola. Es de textura ligera y olor muy agradable. Al aplicarlo queda un efecto glowy .  Creo le encontré más usos. Me gustó mucho🤩
"Not bad this, oil nice smell, nice tanning"
"Saw this on Amazon and thought I would try for its application which is a bar stick of a great skin protector. It is even better than what I thought. For the face, it is great for all your facial contours. It goes on smooth and there is no dripping from a tube. You can apply it in the car if you forget to apply it in the house. Great product- not greasy and no chalky white look either."
"El protector solar Neutrogena con FPS 50 es uno de mis favoritos. Su textura es ligera y se absorbe rápido, así que no deja esa sensación grasosa que a veces tienen otros. Me gusta que no irrita la piel y que me siento protegida todo el día. Además, su tamaño es ideal para llevar en el bolso. Lo he estado usando a diario y definitivamente lo recomendaría."
"This is by far my favorite facial sunscreen stick for the past 2 years.  Having sensitive skin, I've used many different ""natural"" and zinc oxide sunscreens, so I'm familiar with heavy, white, gloppy creams that are impossible to blend in to your skin.  Not so with this one.  Like any stick, it needs to be blended with your fingers, but a light touch is all that's needed to smooth it over facial angles and along your hairline.  If you smash the stick into your face so that white chunks are everywhere, you may be using a heavier touch than necessary.  It doesn't sting, I don't notice a white tint, and I love that it's not greasy. It's been effective for summer field days at home and on tropical beaches when applied regularly. It's small and has nothing to leak, so it's easy to do that. I keep it with me - one in my purse and one in my bike bag - so it's easier to use it more often."
"As a woman of color most sunscreens show up with a white cast. This one absorbs well. I used it for a full week in the Louisiana sun and I didn’t burn, nor did it hurt my hyperpigmentation around the mouth. It is smaller than I thought but the convenience of a stick application makes it easy to track usage. I’m pleased and will buy it again."
Has a bit of white cast if you apply more than a couple passes. Most sun sticks require 4-5 passes to get UV protection so it's not quite enough product to last more than a month with regular daily use but I just keep it at the office in case I forgot to apply sunscreen that morning. Don't keep it in a hot car otherwise it will melt!
"Tends to melt a little in the heat. Also, it’s quite small; I was disappointed in its size. Will stick with the neutrogena bar, which never melts & feels like I’m wearing nothing on my face; no clumps (like this one)."
"It’s the perfect size to take with you everywhere you go, the texture is pretty thick so you need to rub it in well. I live in arizona and have left it in my car in 120+ degrees and it didn’t melt which is r great."
I keep this in my golf bag so I can apply to my right hand that isn't gloved.  Noticed it was getting darker and my gloved hand was staying light.  Solves the problem and doesn't get your fingers greasy from applying!
Es muy pequeño pero la verdad es que es bueno. Deja una capa blanquecina pero no afecta una vez se absorbe. No es grasoso y no he notado que afecte mi piel.
"I've tried all sorts of sun creams to try and find one that doesn't irritate our eyes, especially my daughter who has sensitive skin and this is the one!My daughter has really struggled with other suncreams used previously, rubbing her eyes and face constantly and taking all the sun cream off.. but have just had 2 weeks in Lanzarote, we all wore this on our faces and none of us burnt or had stinging eyes. We used 2 sticks in 2 weeks, worth every penny!"
This product gives you a best coverage of a protection from a sunrays....❤️
"It’s nothing close to sheer. Been using another brand that goes on easily without the white tint and very disappointed to see flakes and patches on first application. Definitely requires fingers work to spread it evenly. Very sticky to touch as well, going to feel heavy skin with the summer heat and humidity. Really disappointed with this. Definitely going back to my other sunstick."
"Buena opción para bloqueador en barra, no deja residuo ni mancha"
"Spray on works the best and banana boat has the best spray. I’ve gotten this set several times now and it’s literally the only one I like to use and my boyfriend is very pale (midwestern) and it works fabulously for him. I recommend this to everyone even if you don’t need a high spf, it’s the best."
Summer vacation to the beach last year was a disaster using 70spf. This year I bought this product and no problems.I would say it not only kept me from burning but tanning as well. I'm not blaming this product though for real since I have 2 colors red and Norwegian white.
This is super easy to put on and doesn’t make my skin feel gross. It holds up well after swimming and helps prevent burns when other brands seemed to fail. It does leave a little “oil” residue look in the water but I might not have let it dry into my skin long enough.
"De alta cobertura, lo recomiendo"
Apply properly and reapply appropriately and it does exactly what it's supposed to.The only downfall is the spray cans do not last long. I'm a bucket for convenient and easy so I buy it anyway.
"I bought several of the SPF 100 sprays for a beach vacation, it sprays without leaving any residue and feels lightweight. It’s a must-have for the summer, especially if you plan on spending an entire day outdoors. It is pricier than some of the lower SPF sprays, but really worth it and protects well."
Great great to apply on a sunny day at the beach or even if you are out for a run.
I bought a few weeks ago it’s working very well. I’m happy.
ME ENCANTÓ
"Sowohl SPF 50 und 100 für Längere Wassersportaktivitäten (2 h Jetski Tour) bei extrem hoher uv intensität (Dubai, Anfang September) gekauftPerfekter Schutz. Lässt sich super bequem auftragen"
Easy to spread. Rapidly absorbs. Excellent sunnprotec
I am using it when I go swimming and it really prevents chlorine tanning .It is expensive but worth it.I strongly recommend it.
"Wir sind gerade in der Türkei und mein Sohn verbrennt sich immer sofort. Gestern den ganzen Tag unterwegs gewesen und sehr viel Sonne den ganzen Tag. Mein Sohn hat sich das erste Mal überhaupt nicht verbrannt, bin absolut begeistert. Für den nächsten Sommer ist das Spray wieder meine erste Wahl. Super!"
I’ve been using this sunscreen for 10 yrs. I wouldn’t use any other. Not only do I use it to protect my skin but I use it as a moisturizer even on the days when I don’t go outside. It’s lightweight and non greasy. I also like how easily my makeup application goes on smoothly.  I would definitely recommend.
"I love this product, but it took about 5 X’s to be delivered than the original time frame. I thought that they had canceled my order and forgot to tell me."
"I’ve been using this for years.  It’s light on the skin, has no scent and it WORKS!  I’ve never gotten sunburned - even in Jamaica."
Easy to use
This sunscreen leaves your skin feeling smooth. It is truly sheer and doesn’t leave an oily residue. Great coverage from the sun!
"I use this product for all body areas which are exposed to sun when I go out except my face . I like it because it is easy to apply, moisturizing and dissolves easily into my skin ."
"We don’t have trouble with this formula. It’s tough to find a consistency and finish everyone can agree with, and this sunscreen formula has minimized that issue. There’s no apparent highlight about it being especially good for any sensitive skin issues, but I’d care to note that my kid that can get clusters of teensy hive-like bumps from some formulas has zero problems with using this. I’ve also experienced a bizarre photo-sensitive situation (that went systemic fast) from an alternate brand’s high SPF melt-in milk that markets itself as especially good for sensitive skin. I’m glad I tried it on me before my kid, but a day pushing 100 degrees plus a load of salty sweat did not do well with that high concentration of salate ingredients. So 10% of any of the salates is a big red flag to me for formulas in general. This Dry Touch and the Hydro Boost are my reliable saints for sunshine."
Great quality - TSA approved so great for carry ons. Sunscreen goes on lightly so you don't feel weighed down.
I have used this sunblock for several years. It is less greasy than some other sunblock.
"I have an oily face and I’ve been looking for a sunscreen with a more watery texture. THIS IS IT. It leaves me with a nice dewy but NOT greasy appearance which has been my concern with a lot of sunscreens!!  I was literally BLOTTING oil off my face using Eucerin’s “oil control” sunscreen. Yeah right. This is the real deal. Does it burn the eyes? I’m  too traumatized by sunscreen eye burning to allow any sunscreen directly on my eyelids. BUT I can say that the times that I’ve rubbed my eyes after applying this sunscreen, there is a momentary burn but it is gone in a minute or so. 1000% recommend to those who are in search of an ACTUAL non greasy formula"
"I can’t tell you the number of sunscreens I’ve tried.  I hate the way they feel on my face.  Sticky, shiny, white!  Yes it’s small and yes it’s a little pricey but oh my gosh!  It went in just like a moisturizer.  I could not feel anything on my face.  I’ve heard Korean skin care is good, and they hit the ball on this sunscreen."
I subscribe to this sunscreen and have been using it for about 3 years.  It is lightweight and has no white cast.  Good consistency that spreads easy like a face lotion.  It sinks into my skin quickly.  I use a makeup primer over it and then apply my foundation and I've had no problem layering.
"I’m giving this all the stars, I willBe buying it again.  I like this brand overall but my first time using their sun protection.  Korean beauty doesn’t play about the uv rays - but this formula is smooth and it creates a glowing effect on the skin.  Would recommend.  I would always like if these bottles were a little bigger, even if the price is higher it would be convenient.  Neither here nor there, it’s a winner"
No white residue but you do need to rub it in for a minute which isn’t a bad thing because us ladies need an extra minute sometimes! Definitely helps with the sun because I’ve gone to layout by the pool (in Florida) and haven’t gotten sunburnt so it must work! Doesn’t seem to clog my pores which is a bonus!
"I like the light texture, it absorbs quickly and doesn't sting my eyes."
"Been using for years. Used to buy at Sephora until they stopped selling it a while ago. It’s silicone free which is a must, non greasy, thin but still would be good enough as a moisturizer alone for oily skin, no scent (at least not strong), doesnt burn, spf 50, perfect over my moisturizer (i find that anything layered pills on me so i wait a bit and use as last step in skin care, as you are supposed to!!) perfect for oily, dry, normal, and/or sensitive skin imo, but cant really speak on that with certainty."
"This sunscreen is the best I have ever used. It is so nice and moisturizing on the skin. It works perfectly under makeup or on top of skin care products. Absolutely no white cast. I haven’t had any eye stinging either. Normally if I accidentally go too close to the eye with other brands, my eyes will sting and water. Not with this one. Also, a little goes a long way. Just a pea sized amount will cover the entire face so it’s going to last a long time. I am so glad I finally found the perfect sunscreen. Absolutely no complaints!"
"I am the palest of the pale and burn extremely easily. If I sit too close to a window I burn. I was told to use sunscreen any time that I’m outside and I decided to try this one out for the summer. I reapply it every two hours or so, more often if I’m sweating a lot or I feel like it’s especially bright. I went to zoos, festivals, did yard work, all kinds of things this summer and didn’t get burnt once. I didn’t do anything water-related so I can’t vouch for it in that aspect. It did once get in my eyes but that was my fault. I would really avoid spraying your face with this and use a cream on your face instead. I will use this forever I think!!"
I really like this.  It isn't greasy and it smells great
"The Neutrogena Beach Defense Sunscreen Spray SPF 50 is my go-to choice for staying protected in the sun. Here's why I highly recommend this sunscreen:Effective Sun Protection: With SPF 50 and broad-spectrum coverage, this sunscreen provides superior protection against both UVA and UVB rays.

It stays put even during intense physical activities, providing reliable sun protection without the need for frequent reapplication.Fast-Drying: One of the things I love most about this sunscreen is how quickly it dries on my skin. Unlike some other sunscreens that leave a greasy or sticky residue, this spray absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling smooth and dry to the touch.Transparent Application: The transparent formula goes on smoothly and evenly, without leaving behind any white streaks or residue. It's virtually invisible once applied, so I can enjoy the sun without looking like I'm wearing sunscreen.PABA-Free & Oxybenzone-Free: I appreciate that this sunscreen is free of potentially harmful ingredients like PABA and oxybenzone. It's formulated with safety and efficacy in mind, giving me peace of mind knowing that I'm using a high-quality product on my skin.Final Thoughts: Overall, the Neutrogena Beach Defense Sunscreen Spray SPF 50 is a top-notch sunscreen that I trust to keep my skin safe and protected under the sun. Its water-resistant, fast-drying formula, combined with its broad-spectrum coverage, makes it the ideal choice for anyone with an active outdoor lifestyle. I highly recommend giving it a try—you won't be disappointed!"
"Buen producto, huele como a cocoNo es pegajoso, cumple con lo que prometeEs tamaño grande"
I trust Neutrogena products and when I saw this on Amazon I thought I'd try it.  The fact that this is a spray on sunscreen and has an SPF of 50 made the decision for me.
My husbands favorite sun block. Works well and doesn’t clog pores.
It sprays on so nice!  Great coverage when spraying.  And skin feels good with it on.  Very happy with it!!!!!!
What a great deal for a high quality product. Worked well and the product inside goes a long way.
"Whenever a favorite sunscreen ceases to be available, I have to try a bunch of new ones. Most are given away, ‘cause I can’t stand any heaviness or greasiness. Even the ones with reviews that say the product isn’t greasy feel heavy/greasy to me - that includes word-of-mouth recommendations from friends. This one totally works for me - mostly, I forget that I applied it; only rarely do I notice that it’s on."
Dermatologist wanted me to be sure to use high % SPF moisturizer every day. This fits the bill and for a lower price than some.
Excellent! Thanks!
"I hate the feel of most sunscreen on my face.  This is the only sunscreen sold in the USA that doesnt dry out my skin, feel oily or just feel weird.  Europe and Asia have a great deal more options and I typically load up on them when i travel, but this is the best i have ever found domestically."
"This sunscreen has convinced my fair skinned, freckled husband to start using sunscreen daily. Also: smells good, no heavy sunscreen scent.Applies easily, and soaks in quickly. After a minute or two I forget I’m wearing sunscreen at all. Has protected my pale face all summer."
Great quality
Best
"I like the moisturizing properties of this sunscreen, and enjoy the pleasant scent."
"Fácil de aplicar, súper ligero no es grasoso pero si deja la piel ligeramente brillante"
"No es totalmente mate pero tampoco deja sensación  grasosa , se absorbe muy bien , tiene un olor sutil muy rico que permanece y la presentación es muy económica para la  calidad de producto , sensación no incomoda contra textiles y no los mancha , el envío muy rápido ♥️ 9/10"
Bastante bueno y se siente ligero!!!
"El protector es grasoso y un poco pesado, no es para pieles grasas."
La publicación da a entender que son 3 y solo llega 1
"This sunscreen is THE ONE. It goes on like lotion and it smells so so so goood. It does not leave any sticky residue whatsoever and leaves you with the prettiest glow. It absorbs really well into the skin. Not one sunburn and protecting my skin from aging and cancer. EVEN MY TODDLER likes it! And she hates putting on lotion, but she will put on this sunscreen, if that doesn’t convince you, idk what will. Again, not sticky, very moisturizing, and subtle ans amazing coconut scent"
This works great. Traveled to Hawaii and was worried about a big sunburn since I am a red headed fair skinned fry baby.  Spent 2 1/2 days at the beach without burning.  It works!!!!!
Not very greasy and goes on great.  Love the scent.
"I love the aroma and how it applies. It’s translucent, no white cast. I use it for the body."
This is the best sunscreen ever - iykyk that Hawaiian Tropic smells like sunshine and the beach. There is glitter in it so beware but I love it.
"Scent- Smells really good. The smell is almost too strong because it over powers my perfume and I can still smell it 8 hours later.Texture - A bit heavy, and a little greasy.There are very small sparkles in it that I wouldnt have noticed if not for another review. I actually really love glitter so its not an issue for me. Honestly the sparkles are so small you cant even see them unless you look for them.Overall: I like this sunscreen a lot. I needed a new body sunscreen and usually use Japanese or Korean brands but wanted to give this one a shot since I like their spray sunscreen. I think it is a bit too heavy so I am not sure if I will repurchase for daily wear, but for something like the beach or pool it is perfect."
"I’ll start this off by saying I’m both cool toned and very fair skinned…some may call me fluorescent beige or the ghost of Christmas past but that is all to say I burn EASILY. Like burn through 7 layers of sunscreen and a flannel, easily.I tried a few other sunscreens last year, including a few for babies since that was suggested to me multiple times but none seemed to help.I’m not sure why I decided to try this one but the thought of a sheer SPF 70 was probably appealing.The first time I used this, I put a big dollop on my arms and phew…it was NOT sheer. People immediately were looking at me like I was crazy for applying so much sunscreen but I was determined to look like a normal human so I brushed them off and said “it’s fine, you just have to rub it in for a while” and my intuition on that response was correct. Do not wipe any off, keep rubbing it in, giving some time between for your skin to absorb it.Let me be completely clear: for this to work for super fair skin, you will need to look like you just took a dive in a vat of whipped cream for a few minutes and your arms WILL get tired from all the rubbing but I promise it’s worth it.I put this on ONCE at the Indy 500, a baseball game, 4 days at Disney Parks, Kings Island, and Cedar Point and I did not burn once. I actually got a bit of a tan which I don’t think has ever happened to me before.Highly recommend this sunscreen for my fair skinned friends!"
Me parece muy bien el producto
Been using the tanning oil since I started suntanning. SPF 70 is wonderful for weather these days. Smells good n it doesn’t leave behind a sticky feel after application. Skin condition improves usage. Will definitely buy more for my whole family 👍
"I have fair skin to begin with.  We have spray sunscreens to use when outside and on the pig.  When I went back on chemo, I knew I had to have skin protection daily.  I did not want to use chemicals or unfamiliar brands.  I have been u a ing Aveeno products for a long time.  While looking up chemo products and the brands I know work with my sensitive skin.  This is great.  I put it on every morning when gwtting cleaned and dressed.  It is a regular lotion, not the sunscreen smelly stuff you usually find.  Growing up, i was always told to wash sunscreen off before bed.  I like skin protection in my products.  10 months on chemo, spending time outdoors, no sunburns!  No irritation, my skin is moisturized and soft.  I just bought my second bottle.  It has lasted a good 6 months, so for the price it lasts long.  I have been unable to find in stores, so I have it on subscription.  My family uses it too and likes it.  It is now part of my daily skin care.  I wish it was a bit lower in price, but it works and I recommend it for all.  I also like it a higher spf than most daily lotions."
"This sunscreen is amazing!I have tried MANY sunscreens, this is one of the few that doesn't give me a skin reaction.  I have highly sensitive skin and a very light complexion. So when I have a reaction with sunscreens my skin feels like its burning and turns a dark pink color.I had previously tried 2 products that listed 'oats' as an ingredient both of which had given me serious reactions. So I was weary to try this product but was convinced by a friend during a camping trip. After using it on my hands and arms for a few hours I tried it on my face as well. I have found that my face is by far the most sensitive so this was the final challenge.Needless to say the product passed! No reaction and the smell is pleasant enough that I didn't mind it on my face. Plus no white cast! I don't plan on using this as everyday sunscreen on my face but the fact that it worked made me immediately buy this product after I returned from my trip. It feels very smooth and in my opinion hydrating.Will be repurchasing in the future as long as the formula never changes!"
"I love that this is a spf lotion. it saves time in the mornings. I was using mineral sunscreen because I heard its better for you, but i found i was more likely to skip in the morning because it took so long to blend in, and it called for lotion. This spreads very easily. It makes me worry I'm not putting on enough to get the whole 60 spf. It is scented like oatmeal, which is fine, but I cant use it on my face with the perfume. The only issue is the cap isnt secure, so it leaks on the rest of my mail."
"It doesnt have much of a smell or weird texture to it, but it does leave my skin and hands feeling a little sticky after applying (almost like sunblock). I was hoping it was going to be a little more subtle than that. Otherwise the product is great, it does provide the sun protection and moisturizing I was looking for"
"It’s not greasy once applied and it smells nice. One thing is it burns my eyes when I apply it to my face, however, I have discovered that if I keep my eyes closed during the application I don’t end up getting that burning sensation throughout the day. So I use this on the face, neck and chest with no issues. I love it."
I tried to blipper the tremendous ploober with GOBS of hot steaming googie but the gloober got realinened with the awesome plicky nester! 👈🥴👉So what I had to do was trickle a smidgen more glappenschmacker on the wicky wacky till it was smooth silky and full of GLORIOUS LOVE!! Now everything is amazingly more better!! ✌😳✌
"I wanted something that felt primarily like a moisturizer,  but with the added benefit of sun protection.  This is that. Light scent, smells a bit like honey to me, because I don't like typical sunscreen scents - for everyday, I don't want to smell like coconut or like I've been out at the beach suntanning."
Really high protection and leave the skin moist. I didnt love the scent but its ok
Me gustó mucho!  se absorbe y no deja capa blanca!
Well received very good body sun lotion
"Very good. Quick dry and not sticky ( i used it for body only). As sunscreen is essential to our skincare, all must be available in a large quantity like this aveeno. Very good deal."

"Guys this is seriously the best sunscreen i have tried. I have been previously using the Cerave tinted spf 30 sunscreen (which i do love) but was wanting something with a higher spf. I am SUPER acne prone and already have mild acne, so i am very picky and nervous when trying new things ESPECIALLY sunscreens. I thought I was going to have to give up trying to find an affordable 50+ spf and just get the Elta MD one, which I see everyone using (it is literally $40!!). Then I came across this Eucerin one and decided to give it a shot. WOW.First of all it comes in a 2.5oz bottle which is almost DOUBLE what you get in a standard face sunscreen for a fraction of the cost, it also has pump (one that works very good) which is a total plus.Second, it’s not super thick and it rubs in like a moisturizer, which i personally love. It also leave absolutely no white cast on me, though i do have light-medium skin tone so I can’t speak for how it would perform on darker skin tones.Third, I have been using it for about 2 weeks and I have not had a breakout. It says oil control and at first I was like yeah right they all say that, but it will seriously be the end of the day and i will not be oily in the slightest. It is seriously insane. It also layers under makeup nicely and does not pill!The only thing i don’t love is the smell. It definitely smells like your standard sunscreen smell mixed with alcohol, but with how good the product is this is not a deal breaker for me. And the smell is only there when you are applying it."
"I really like this sunscreen. I first tried it after borrowing it from my boyfriend's mom, and I decided to buy it afterward. No whitecast. It looks a little oily on my face immediately after applying, but then looks more ""glowy"" after it soaks in a bit. Note: on the back, it says to ""use a water-resistant sunscreen if swimming or sweating,"" which I take to mean that this is not water-resistant and I should be using something else on my face if I plan on going into the pool or ocean."
No white cast and I love it. It gives my skin just a little bit of shine but I don’t mind. I prefer that over looking white. Massage it into your skin and that’s it.
"I use this SPF every single day and I have to say I really like everything about it. Only reason I did not give it 5 starts is because I WISHED it was mattifying like it advertises but it is the complete opposite (at least for me). I have always been very oily (especially in the forehead) and was hoping this would help with managing the oil in that area but I have not seen a difference. I enjoy it because it really is, most importantly for me, clear on the skin and soft. As a person that does not ever really put on any makeup beyond eyeliner and lipstick, I simply put on some translucent makeup setting powder (I use MAC) and it instantly mattifies my skin so then I'm good to go and sun protected. I would still recommend to anyone!"
"The quality of this sunscreen is really good, it does not feel grassy when you apply which is great since I’ve oily skin face. I’ll buy it again."
Muy efectivo y bueno me salio
"I have tried many different brands and they either make me break out or dry out my skin. This is the best one I have ever used. It does not leave a white cast or oily residue, no breakouts, and my skin feels moisturized. It also layers really well with my make-up. 100% recommend if you have sensitive skin!"
"Esta formula no es la misma de los productos hechos en Alemania. Deja la piel aceitosa, solo compraré Eucerin con fórmula hecha en Alemania."
"La botella muy grande por lo que aprovecho para usar una generosa cantidad, si queda un poquito grasosa la piel después de aplicarlo, yo creo porque uso mucha cantidad a pesar que soy de piel seca pero nada que el polvo sellador no resuelva, como todos los productos de esta marca es excelente."
"After trying soooo many sunscreen I think this is  my preferred one ,as my skin is oily even the one that said oil free will drive my skin to shine ,this will not stop the shine not reduce it oily skin will always be oily is just the texture works better and definitely the protection is good."
Blends and absorbs easily; little white cast left on my face. I do find this sunscreen a little heavy for my oily skin; requires some blotting with the tissue after application.
"Bien, siempre compro Eucerin en protectores solares fáciles y los amo mucho."
